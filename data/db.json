      "article": "The Lamp is Golden tells the story of the Lamont hospital and its School of Nursing.\n\nThe nurse was indeed the mainstay of the hospital in these early years. She not only tended the furnace, she saw that there was an adequate supply of water. The pump and the well did not always function together and when a shortage of water was imminent, she filled enough containers from various sources to carry on. There is a record of at least one complete failure to secure water in the hospital. A bucket brigade was formed, by nurses who were able to be off duty, from a not too near-by well and enough water was had to save the day. There was never a plentiful supply and conservation had to be practised by all.\n\nThe nurses made sure the patients had adequate meals too. If necessary they cooked them. All the laundry for the newborn babies was done by the nurse. On occasion she was known to struggle with the harness of a horse, hitch the animal to a buggy and fetch the milk for use in the hospital, this when the milk-man was unable to deliver his product on time.\n\nGraduation was a time when the countryside entered into the celebrations. Invitations were not mailed out, but friends of the graduates and hospital were cordially welcomed to the reception given by the doctor's wives, the graduate nurses of the hospital and those living in the district. The Graduation Exercises were held in the evening in the church, which usually could not accommodate the crowds attending, for the warmth and friendliness shown by the community towards the doctors, nurses and the hospital was then, and still is, something unique.\n\nRegulations for student nurses seemed to be a matter of one girl informing another. There was nothing written down, but one found out that 'in at night' was ten o'clock with lights out at 10:30. Late leaves were granted once a week till 11:30--no sleep outs. No sign-ins or sign-outs, it was strictly an honour system and seldom abused. The morning bell was rung by the night nurse at 6:00 o'clock (she used the same 'cow bell' that was put away with other antiquities of earlier days when the new residence was opened.) Breakfast was at 6:30, after which all the students and staff nurses who were on day duty, lined up in the matron's office at 6:45 for prayers and the reading of the night reports. Floor duty began promptly at 7:00 a.m.\n\nHours off duty were posted by the matron daily. Two hours a day and one-half day a week, beginning at 2:00 p.m. was allowed. Sunday was special! Two nurses were off duty until noon, but they were required to relieve the night nurses, who did not come on duty till 9:00 p.m. Four hours off on Sunday was usual for all other nurses, and statutory holidays were observed by four hours off duty, when it could be arranged.\n\nBecause the hospital was largely maintained by the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, the students and nursing staff were forbidden to dance or attend dances. The playing of cards was frowned upon and smoking or drinking would not have been tolerated. The preparation of food in the 'Home' was not permitted. The regular attendance at church when off duty hours would allow, was a must.\n\nThese regulations, as you might expect, have been changed over the years.\n\nWith permission.",

      "article": "Two doctors had already been practising medicine in Calgary by 1883, but no hospital was available to them. In 1886 a hospital committee was formed, perhaps spurred on by a bequest of $600. A grant of land wasn't obtained until 1889 and the following year, with the hospital still not built, a building was rented and opened as the first hospital in Calgary. The first matron was, unusually for the times, a married woman and her husband became the night supervisor and general handyman for the hospital. They could look after four patients upstairs and four, down. In the building there was also an office and a nurses' dining room that often had to double as an operating theatre.\n\nPerhaps the smallpox epidemic of 1892 spurred them on as in September of 1894 the corner stone was laid for the new building. It eventually opened with Mary Ellen Birtles as Superintendent of Nurses. The training school opened in 1895 with Marion Moodie as its first probationer. At the time she described the old hospital: ‘The building of Calgary's first hospital had seen the earlier and rougher days of the town, and when taken over as a hospital had bullet holes through some of the doors.’ This was where she began her training until the stone hospital was completed.\n\nThe city grew by leaps and bounds and in 1901 the hospital was moved to another new building across the Bow River and the old one was retained as an isolation hospital. There were now twenty-five nurses on staff at the new Calgary General and eight general duty nurses.\n\nCalgary General has seen many changes over the years. In 1921 the nurses operated a free ‘well baby clinic’ for some time although it was decided that this was not a great location for the babies as it was drafty! When the 1950s saw the restructuring of the relationship between nursing schools and hospitals, Calgary General was one of the first to separate the two functions.\n\nIn the 1960s Calgary General had the distinction of having the first Staff Nurses Association certified as a bargaining unit under the Labour Act. And in 1977, it was one of the group of seven hospitals that went on strike under the newly organized United Nurses of Alberta. The strike lasted for six days and then the nurses were ordered back to work.\n\nIn 1992 the Bow Valley Centre, the former Calgary General Hospital, was closed because of government health care cuts. Many nurses and other professional personnel were made redundant. The buildings associated with the different parts of the hospital were destroyed by implosion in 1998.\n\n",

      "article": "The Medicine Hat School of Nursing accepted its first class in 1894. Its new matron was Agnes C. Miller. In those early days, it was believed that the young women would think it was such a good opportunity that to “work gratuitously” in order to receive their training.  Over the years, they received very little remuneration for all the work they did in the hospital. Indeed, during the Depression years, young women did see nursing training as an opportunity to make a little money while getting some training at the same time.\n\nDuring both the first and second world wars the numbers of applications for the school were down as lucrative war work offered. And after the Second World War, the less traditional work prevailed and open houses were held to try and attract new students. It is interesting that there never were any male students in the whole history of the Medicine Hat School of Nursing.\n\nIn those early years, too, there were two, sometimes three, 'intakes' throughout the year with each group remaining quite separate and distinct from the others. By 1953, it was down to one intake per year in September.\n\nStudents were always required to 'live in' and from 1894 to 1904 they lived on the top floor of the hospital. As the number of students grew, they were also housed throughout the hospital, being moved when paying patients needed the beds, and often catching whatever was brought to the hospital by way of infection.\n\nThe Women's Hospital Aid Society took over fund-raising for a separate residence, and a new brick building was erected and officially opened in 1905. It had nine bedrooms, a parlour-library and a kitchen. It was called the Victoria Nurses' Home in honour of Queen Victoria who had died in 1901.\n\nThis new building became too small quite quickly and after shoe-horning one or two more in for a while, an addition was built in 1912, another in 1919, and again in1930. In the late 1940s, students were accommodated in the maternity hospital and in 1949 a house across the street from the main hospital was leased for five years as the 'Nurses' Annex.'\n\nBut talk of new premises for the hospital was in the air and the nursing residence was not to be left behind.",

      "title": "Lethbridge: A coal company funds nursing",
      "article": "Sir Alexander Galt founded the NorthWest Coal and Navigation Company in 1882. His interesting partners were W.H. Smith (yes, the book people) and William Lethbridge, after whom, of course, the town was named. The Galt Mines formed the foundation of Lethbridge, which in its beginnings had been called Coaltown and it was in conjunction with these mines that the hospital was built in 1891.\n\nThe original building was a gracious two-storey affair with an upstairs balcony and a downstairs verandah. Dr. Frank Mewburn was its Superintendent and it boasted four nurses and three other employees, to look after a planned six patients--which quickly rose to fifteen. The top floor of the hospital was used for staff accommodation which was an advantage (or disadvantage, depending on your point of view) for any emergencies arising in the hospital.\n\nThe financing for the running of the hospital was quite interesting for the time. Twenty-five cents per month came from railway and coal company employee deductions, the government grant was twenty-nine cents per day for each free patient, the town of Lethbridge contributed four hundred dollars a year, and some more affluent patients paid their own way.\n\nA new hospital was built in 1907 with equal backing from the Galt family and the city of Lethbridge. It was a red brick structure and, accommodating sixty-five patients and a nurses' residence, was built at the same time. Leah Poelman's book , White Caps and Red Roses tells a funny story of having the Prime Minister, Sir Wilfred Laurier, come to open the new hospital and being kept waiting on the front step while somebody went looking for the door key.\n\nThe Galt Hospital Training School had rules and regulations that were as strict here as in any other school. The students did get a small stipend for the incredible number of hours they put in--eight dollars a month as juniors, ten dollars in their second year, and twelve in their third. The list of clothing they had to supply to begin their training is amazing. According to Poelman, they needed two plain dresses, eight large white aprons, a supply of plain underwear (including two coloured underskirts--washable), two large laundry bags, a pair of ‘common-sense’ boots, a thimble, scissors, watch and a table napkin ring.\n\nWhatever their upbringing before they arrived at the school--probably fairly sheltered for many--they quickly learned to bathe miners, clean up gruesome operating theatres, and attend autopsies, often very early in their training--probably a good method of weaning out the weak of stomach.\n\nMaternity patients went to a special maternity home run by a mid-wife. Nurses in training spent a month there on day duty and another month there on night duty as part of their training.\n\nThere was a high dropout rate in the early days of the school. In the 1913 class, of the fifteen who originally enrolled, only three completed the training. The 1914 class managed three out of eleven who began and, a few years later, only one of nine graduated. For many girls at the time it was something to do while they waited to get married, but for others the long twelve-hour working days, followed by the training lectures were probably just too much.",

      "article": "No history of nursing in any location would be complete without at least a mention of Florence Nightingale. Indeed, in the general scheme of things, her influence is quite recent as before her work, nurses were considered the lowliest of the low and good only for cleaning floors and slop buckets.\n\nFlorence Nightingale had a fairly direct influence on nursing in Alberta as well. The first matron of the first hospital in Medicine Hat, Grace Reynolds, was Alberta's direct nursing connection to Florence Nightingale. She had been trained in Britain by a Miss Gordon who had been a student of Florence Nightingale's.\n\nIt wasn't until she did some training in a German school for deaconesses, much desired by her and totally opposed by her parents, that Florence Nightingale began to see how things could be improved. This was in 1851.\n\nThrough some social connections that she was asked to go to Turkey, the site of the Crimean War. She was asked to go to see what could be done to improve the conditions in the medical facilities, particularly by the introduction of nurses. Against a fair amount of opposition from the doctors there, she and her nurses began work and overwhelmed the soldiers with their care and kindness. She continued to work on their behalf when she returned to England, taking an active role in a commission to investigate the health and health facilities of the British Army.\n\nIn 1860 she established the Nightingale Training School for nurses in London. The young women received a year's training, some of it in lecture form, but most of it in the form of practical work on the wards. When they completed their training, the nurses staffed hospitals in Britain and overseas, as well as establishing other training schools. Miss Nightingale continued to be involved in the school, evaluating programs and nurses over the years. She also published her little book, Notes on Nursing , with its emphasis on observation and sensitivity to the patient's needs. It is still in print today in many languages.\n\nFlorence Nightingale believed strongly in the importance of hygiene, although her scientific knowledge wasn't up to ‘germs’ yet. Thanks to this belief, working conditions in hospitals improved.  Her work in the district nursing field also helped improve the conditions where people were treated in their homes.\n\nFlorence Nightingale died in her own home in 1910, at the age of ninety. She has been credited with making nursing a respected profession.",

      "article": "Four Grey Nuns sisters arrived in Calgary at two o'clock of a cold January morning. They and their escort, Father Leduc, walked in the snow and darkness from the train station to the residence of another order seeking lodging. There was not enough room for them to stay, so after a brief rest, a snack and a celebration of the mass, they moved on to the building that was to be their hospital.\n\nAfter finding second-hand furniture and equipment, they accepted their first patient in April. The little four-bed hospital was often overcrowded and the sisters would sleep on the floor or in the cold attic, so that patients could have their beds. A new building was definitely needed and a site was chosen in 1892 on the banks of the Elbow River. The land was donated by the Oblate fathers, who also donated the bricks for the building.\n\nThe Grey Nuns' work was not just within the walls of the new building. Before it was completed, a measles epidemic had required the isolation of many patients--the city set them up in tents and then asked the Grey Nuns if they would look after them there. This they did, of course going into quarantine themselves.\n\nHoly Cross Hospital was ready for partial occupancy by November of 1892 and generous grants in terms of telephone service and electricity, they were able to continue their work.\n\nThe epidemics were the worst times and they often had to sleep on the attic floor of even this new building to accommodate more patients. After the measles epidemic of 1892, diphtheria broke out in the following two summers. More sisters came from Montreal to help, but they all had their hands full. Typhoid and diphtheria epidemics (and even smallpox in 1908) continued to plague Calgary's early years, culminating in the horrendous Spanish flu epidemic at the end of the Great War. The Grey Nuns worked tirelessly throughout all of these, even managing to feed many of the hungry poor who knocked on their hospital door, knowing they wouldn't be turned away.",

      "article": "As any nursing administrator in the early years of the province would admit, a school of nursing was almost de rigueur for the operation of a hospital. Besides being a good recruitment method for its own grad nurses, it was also a major source of (cheap) labour during the students' on-the-job training. Holy Cross was no exception and its School of Nursing was opened in 1907 with five student nurses. Until 1920, the student nurses were housed in the hospital itself, but growing numbers required the purchase and renovation of two other buildings for the students. Complete with a tunnel to the hospital, they became the nursing residence until 1947, when still increasing numbers required a move into the original Holy Cross hospital building.\n\nAlways questioning whether the young students were getting adequate training, Holy Cross was one of the first schools to implement the block system in 1947. In the 1950s discussions were held regarding the possibility of central schools of nursing for Alberta. Feeling strongly that their Ethics course was important to the training of their nurses and that it might not be included, the Catholic schools of nursing rejected the idea.\n\nIn 1957 a beautiful new building was erected that could accommodate two hundred and fifty six student nurses--it was renamed the Grey Nuns Building in 1982. The Grey Nuns left the hospital in 1970 when it was sold to the Calgary Rural and Metro Hospital District No. 93. The Grey Nuns Provincial Council felt that running a hospital meant that there should be sisters in the key positions and there were fewer and fewer sisters in the organization.\n\nThe school of nursing closed in 1979.",

      "title": "Nurses in residence: the history of residential nursing schools",
      "article": "Nursing is now considered a profession and respected as one, but reaching this level of regard has involved over a hundred years of struggle. The art of administering to the sick and wounded, to the dying, and to those bearing children has been known since the beginning of time. Religious orders did give succor to the ill and less fortunate, but the idea of bringing together in a planned program a group to fill these needs is relatively new and can be attributed to Florence Nightingale.\n\nThe need for residence living evolved as a result of long working hours which commenced early in the day, inappropriate living conditions outside most institutions and poor transportation...\n\nHospitals in Canada first appeared in Upper and Lower Canada and, with the establishment of transportation routes and movement of population, started to develop in the west. Early settlers followed waterways or wagon trails, but the greatest movement of people came with the building of the railway. As the population in the west increased, the need for health care became evident. Nurses, mostly graduates of Eastern hospitals, influenced the new hospital schools of nursing by copying residence discipline, programs of study and uniforms after their own schools.\n\nIn 1883, railways brought the first great infusion of workers and immigrants to Medicine Hat as the Canadian Pacific Railway and later the Canadian Northern Railway continued west. Individuals who had an aptitude for caring for the sick and pregnant women frequently did this in their homes, which fostered the development of the cottage hospital. Pest or isolation houses developed in the same way. A need arose for more skilled personnel and a home for patients of the horse and buggy doctor grew dependent upon the finances of the area. Larger centres attracted more professional people, many who belonged to Religious orders. Calgary and Edmonton soon had well-constructed serviceable institutions (hospitals) with established schools of nursing as a cheap way to staff the hospital.\n\nIn the early days hospitals recruited older single women, in the twenty-five to thirty-five year age bracket who might then have been called 'spinsters', and who desperately needed to have some way to care for themselves. Discipline was strict and the work demanded long hours, frequently fourteen-sixteen hours a day everyday of the week. Attrition was high and many students succumbed to illness. Students were confined to the hospital and residence by work and by their tired bodies. Any deviation from their rigorous routine was suppressed by their supervisors. If they were allowed to go home, there was a fear on the part of supervisors that they might not return.\n\nInitially educational requirements were only that a potential student could write English. That a candidate was of high moral reputation was attested to by upstanding people in the community, one usually a church leader. Individual students were required to be church goers.\n\nDuring the hundred years that resident schools of nursing existed in Alberta, several social influences have helped or hindered the growth of nursing in the province. Certainly the population explosion that occurred early in the twentieth century brought the natural and human resources of the west into predominance. Immigration increased, encouraged by the Homestead Act and the lure of 'free land.' Real estate boomed and then fell. World War I took young men and returned invalids. Young nurses joined the war cause, leaving at home a demand and need for student nurses. Young women responded to the call to military duty by entering hospital training programs. Nurses were again needed during the influenza outbreak in 1918-1919 and women responded. The 1929 depression was a bonus for hospitals and their need for cheap labour. Again women looked to the hospitals for a refuge, board and room in return for work. World War II called graduate nurses from hospitals and again young women responded by entering training programs. The war brought new technology and a subtle change in attitudes. Women had proved their worth and they found a new sense of value, having worked alongside men as part of the war effort. The money they earned gave them a further sense of value and freedom. Severe discipline in schools of nursing was no longer tolerated. Threats of student nurse strikes for better treatment resulted in relaxing of the rules and legislation changed working hours. Unions improved working conditions and salaries. A nurse could speak up against injustices without the fear of dismissal. Education programs also changed. Schools of nursing now required a higher level of high school education, until entrance requirements were the same as those for University. In smaller communities nursing schools closed due to lack of qualified instructors and declining enrollments. City hospitals attracted more students, and then made way for a different mode of delivery for nursing education in College diploma programs, and University baccalaureate programs. Students lived out of residence, Hospital based schools of nursing closed and the residences were retired.’\n\nFrom Highs and Lows by Alice Thomas MacKinnon, with permission.",

A true pioneer, Mary Birtles helped start two hospitals and saw many people through injury and illness. Ranchers with broken limbs from being thrown off horses were not unusual patients, but rampaging typhoid filled most of the beds. The disease took the lives of many of the new immigrants to the province and in fact nearly killed Mary Birtles herself.\n\nLike any pioneer, Mary Birtles had to make do, keep up with or invent new methods of treatment and generally find a way to provide good care. She came to Medicine Hat in 1890, to one of the first hospitals in the province, and at the time the only hospital between Winnipeg and Vancouver Island. Miss Birtles became the assistant to Grace Reynolds who was the matron and ran the hospital. Miss Reynolds had been trained in Britain by a Miss Gordon who had been a student of Florence Nightingale's. Working with the physicians, the two nurses did the cooking, the housekeeping and all the nursing in the small hospital. During surgery, Miss Reynolds gave the anaesthetic while Miss Birtle looked after the instruments. If the nurses were able to attend church on Sunday that was their time off for the week.\n\nIn 1891, typhoid hit hard and every bed in the hospital had a typhoid patient. Mary Birtles came down with the disease herself, leaving Grace Reynolds to tend to all the patients as well as her colleague. For six weeks Mary fought the disease and recovered. In 1892, she returned to Manitoba where she had had her nurse training and became senior nurse at the new hospital in Brandon. But in 1894, she returned to Alberta as the first matron at the new Calgary General Hospital. The General began as a cottage hospital with eight beds, but often had as many as seventeen patients.\n\nAseptic procedure was just beginning as the time, and the hospital's disinfectants and simple solutions were purchased from a Calgary pharmacy. Miss Birtles soon learned to mix the compounds herself, saving the hospital almost her whole salary.\n\nWhen a larger General was built, Miss Birtles set up the hospital's School of Nursing, one of the first in the province. She said, ‘I felt I knew very little to face the world with, but by dint of reading and studying and using the powers of observation, I gathered up all I could.’\n\nIn 1897, Miss Birtles travelled back to her native Britain for the Diamond Jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria and, in 1935 was invested in Ottawa with the Order of the British Empire.",

      "title": "Medicine Hat General Hospital: the first regular hospital in 'The Territories'",
      "article": "The first regularly equipped hospital in what was then known as The Territories was built in Medicine Hat in 1889 and four years later it opened the first school of nursing west of Winnipeg. One of the major rules for the new nurses was: ‘Every nurse will be expected to perform any duty assigned to her either as a nurse in the hospital, or when sent to private cases among the rich or poor, in any part of the Territories.’ ‘Any part of the Territories’, covered the area from the forty-ninth parallel to the Arctic and from Winnipeg to the Rocky Mountains. The President of the hospital board pointed out that the nurses were doing a lot of the work that Lady Aberdeen was supporting with the new Victorian Order of Nurses.\n\nThe hospital building was of cut stone and was two full storeys. The mansard roof covered a third level that housed an isolation ward and the nurses. It opened in January of 1890, just in time for a flu epidemic. There were two nurses for the entire hospital--the Matron was Grace Louise Reynolds and her assistant was Mary Ellen Birtles.\n\nGrace Reynolds was Alberta's direct nursing connection to Florence Nightingale. She had been trained in Britain by a Miss Gordon who had been a student of Florence Nightingale's.\n\nMiss Birtles described the scene: ‘Miss Reynolds and I managed the work between us. She prepared the meals and looked after the downstairs work; I attended to the furnace and did the upstairs work, sweeping, dusting, etc. besides attending to the patients. When any surgical work was to be done, we had to arrange the work accordingly. Miss Reynolds gave the anaesthetic and I looked after the instruments and waited on the doctors. There was no sterilizer, so we had to resort to boiling the instruments in a large saucepan with a steamer on it for towels and dressings.’\n\nTyphoid hit hard in 1891 and every bed in the hospital had a typhoid patient in it. Mary Birtles came down with the disease herself, leaving Miss Reynolds to cope with her colleague's illness and all the patients in the hospital. Both Miss Reynolds and Miss Birtles survived the ordeal.\n\nThe stories of most early hospitals are inextricably linked with the stories of their nursing schools. The Medicine Hat school that was opened in 1895 provided a good deal of the nursing care that was actually given on the wards for many years. The young women tended to be thrown in at the deep end and left to sink or swim on their own. Sometimes they were ‘instructed’ by other young women who had been in the same position only two or three months earlier, sometimes they were more fortunate and did a sort of apprenticeship with a more senior nurse. Keeping up with studies after a twelve hour shift (sometimes longer) was only one of their problems.",

      "title": "Formation of the Victorian Order of Nurses in Alberta",
      "article": "The Victorian Order of Nurses began in Canada as a project of the National Council of Women of Canada (NCWC), a branch of the International Council of Women. The President of the International Council was Lady Ishbel Aberdeen, and her husband was Canada's Governor General from 1893 to 1898. The NCWC was particularly concerned with the level of health care for women and children, especially in the remote areas of the North West Territories.\n\nLocal councils were all concerned with doing something about the problems but it was Lady Aberdeen's influence with the federal government that actually put wings to the project. Her idea was that the visiting nurses would be part trained mid-wife, part first aid person, and part home help, particularly in the food preparation area. Women who had lived in the more remote areas would probably be the most useful in doing this work and in understanding the needs. The first proposal didn't get off the ground as many physicians and nurses were concerned about the lower fees the visiting nurses would charge.\n\nGovernment funding was held back because of the opposition to the plan but a revised plan, allowing for ‘the medical men’ to be the prime care-givers for births, left room for the nurses to prepare for and assist the doctors. Of course, if there were no doctor available, the nurse would just have to get on with things. It was proposed, too, that rather than mid-wives with a certificate, hospital nurses with district nursing training would be hired, and that they would serve the entire community, not just the poor, charging fees whenever possible.\n\nA royal charter to establish the Victorian Order of Nurses was granted by Queen Victoria in 1897, the diamond jubilee celebration of her reign. There was a certain religious fervour that went with these nurses and, in light of the new ‘germ theory’, they tackled sanitation issues wherever they went and talked about ‘a healthier mode of living.’ Lady Aberdeen's idea of mid-wives and home helpers rather than fully trained nurses would probably have provided more help to the women and children on the remote homesteads, partly because of lower fees and partly because the shorter training would have been accessible to more women.",

      "title": "The Victorian Order of Nurses (long story of caring in Calgary)",
      "article": "The first president of the Calgary branch of the Victorian Order of Nurses was Mrs. James Lougheed, wife of the senator. The board members in the early days took their interests seriously and were often involved in driving nurses to see patients, when transport was a problem.\n\nAs in other locations, maternity patients were the main clients, although Calgary's somewhat milder climate (for the prairies, anyway) attracted tuberculosis sufferers too, who were often attended by the VON nurse. A good working relationship had been established between the VON and the physicians in Calgary and many referrals for the VON services were made. The influenza epidemic at the end of the Great War required that VON nurses work with the City in visiting and helping influenza victims and their families.\n\nFunding was always a problem, as in other centres, as grants from the City were not the same each year (if they existed at all).  The board relied heavily on fundraising event and the support of other charitable organizations. The board also advertised the services of the nurses, by sending out brochures to medical and pharmaceutical personnel as well as writing newspaper articles and doing radio spots. An interesting note is that Calgary VONs for many years were paid much better than Edmonton VONs doing the same work under pretty well the same conditions.\n\nBy the 1920s, the Calgary branch was working with hospitals and was involved with child welfare work, particularly in the form of baby clinics. Well-advertised ‘baby weeks’ were also held in easy to reach locations, featuring talks and exhibits, as well as the usual weigh-ins and check-ups. Pre-natal classes were also an important part of the VON work.\n\nFocus for the VON was still non-paying patients, perhaps those who fell between the cracks as far as other agencies were concerned, or those who, ill for a long time, had depleted their savings. Cancer patients in particular were grateful for night calls when nurses would administer pain-relieving drugs. During the Depression the work was particularly difficult and heart wrenching, when they were visiting families who had almost nothing and were often hungry.\n\nThe branch was always involved in educating its clients or patients, but in the 1930s it added a formal arrangement with hospitals to give field training to some of their nursing students.\n\nThe Second World War found the nurses in Calgary (as in Edmonton) visiting wives and families of the men who had gone overseas. The support to these mostly young women with young children was invaluable. At the same time the shortages in the number of hospital beds in the city meant more work for the VON nurses for patients convalescing at home rather than staying for the usual convalescence after surgery in the hospital. Eventually this led to more hospital referrals for branch even into the sixties.\n\nModern times in Calgary\n\nThe VON continued to expand in Calgary and change its role in the city as needs arose. A home-care program was proposed to the provincial and municipal governments and eventually began in 1970. It was administered by the VON until 1976. Part of its mandate allowed for children to have day surgery rather than being hospitalized overnight--with the VON nurse visiting the young patient at home, later in the day.\n\nEven after the administration of the home-care program was taken over by first the municipal and then the provincial government, the VON continued to provide its nursing services. The general nursing strike in 1982 led to big changes as nursing salaries increased substantially, and the always struggling board had to reconsider its program. After the VON nurses' own strike three years later, the board decided to change from providing nursing services to providing home health ‘aides’, supervised by a VON nurse.\n\nThe VON continues to help individuals, families and organizations by providing a range of health, wellness and community support services such as foot care, meals-on-wheels, respite and palliative care, and community integration of services.\n\nHome visiting nursing is VON's best-known service. Many people with long or short-term illness, or those who have just had surgery are able to remain or recover at home instead of in hospital because of a wide range of home health services offered by VON. These include companion services, homemaking services and personal care services",

      "article": "Dr. Robert Brett, a company doctor for the Canadian Pacific Railway, established the Brett Sanatorium and Hotel in the 1880s, in response to the discovery of the sulphur hot springs in Banff. Their marvelous healing powers quickly became well-known throughout the world and attracted many wealthy people to come and ‘take the waters.’ The railway hospital treated workers and others above the billiard hall. When the building was overflowing, heated tents were used and these also came in handy for isolation wards when the epidemics of the time hit.\n\nThe story goes that Dr. Brett had a fire lit in one of these tents to house a traveller with pneumonia and it wasn't until someone noticed a strange smell in the area, that they discovered the poor man had been forgotten and had died. Perhaps this spurred the concerned citizens to build a new hospital and the subsequent school of nursing in 1909. Lectures were given to the student nurses by the staff nurses and Dr. Brett and his son, Dr. Harry Brett whenever any of them had the time, and the student nurses received a stipend of between ten and twenty dollars a month.\n\nAs early as 1916, the Registered Nurses Act required that the students receive experience in areas not necessarily present at the Brett Hospital and they had to go to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton to complete their third year. The School of Nursing in Banff closed in 1922. In 1915, Dr. Brett (Sr.) had already left to become the Lieutenant Governor of the province; and by 1929, the Sisters of St. Martha had bought the property. The hospital continued under the Sisters and changed its name to the Banff Mineral Springs Hospital.",

      "article": "The Red Cross organization was formed in response to Henry Dunant's experiences in Italy in 1859. His book encouraged the establishment of a committee whose main purpose was to found an organization that could provide immediate relief and medical attention to those who were wounded or ill as a result of war. The red cross on a white background was adopted in 1863 as the symbol of this work. The Canadian Red Cross was not officially established until 1909. As early as the Riel Resistance in 1885, the work was being done, under the auspices of a doctor who needed to identify the wagon used to transport the wounded. He tore up red material and sewed it on to a white background so that the purpose of the wagon was clearly visible to both sides.\n\nIn 1939, the Canadian Red Cross began preparation for the war that was imminent by establishing branches and divisions across the country. Nurses have worked since the early days of the century in the Red Cross organization, but became embedded in the fabric of society during those horrifying years of the Second World War. When the war was over, the programs still included first aid for accident victims, assistance for wounded veterans and education in the areas of health and safety. And, of course, the Red Cross is most well-known locally for its blood collection and transfusion program.\n\nAlberta nurses have been involved in responses to other disasters besides war. In May of 2000, the Red Cross provided support following an evacuation of 5,000 residents of Red Deer, Alberta following a hazardous chemical spill. And in July of the same year, a tornado that devastated a campground in Pine Lake killed 12 and sent close to 140 to hospital. Over 220 volunteers and staff worked hard to respond to inquiries, and to provide support and medical aid at the campground immediately following the tornado.",

      "title": "Changes in the education of nurses over the century",
      "article": "Criticism of the use of student nurses as cheap labour had begun as early as the 1930s. Change was slow in coming, but started with hospitals feeling the need to hire graduate nurses to provide more complex and sophisticated care. Nurses, to that point, had often found employment as independent practitioners offering care in patients' homes rather than in a hospital setting.\n\nIn the late 1940s, an experimental school in Ontario demonstrated quite clearly that nurses could be trained in two years if the emphasis was on actual training rather than providing cheap labour to the hospital. The next step in Alberta was to establish diploma nursing programs at community colleges.\n\nThe push towards nursing education in settings other than hospitals had come from a number of sources. The Weir Report in 1932 had been the first recommendation and in 1951 Dr. Mildred Montag from Columbia University recommended a similar program. Justice Emmett Hall as chairman of the Royal Commission on Health Services in the sixties was of the same opinion.\n\nAfter 1968, with more money available from the federal government under the Medical Care Act, more hospitals were built and more nurses hired. At the same time, there was a general move across Canada to broaden nurses' training. It included more general education, as well as the hospital training that had been the main part of the diploma nursing school.\n\nThe first programs established at community colleges in Alberta were at Mount Royal College (Calgary) in 1967 and Red Deer College in 1968. Within a very short period similar moves took place in Edmonton, Lethbridge and Medicine Hat. A five-year integrated program was available at the University of Alberta at the same time, and by 1970 both the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary had established four-year integrated programs.\n\nThe Alberta Task Force on Nursing Education was appointed in 1975 and eventually recommended that everyone entering the profession of nursing have a bachelor's degree. There was considerable controversy over this proposal, more studies were done, and the system that resulted was a cooperative effort between community colleges and universities for integrated degree programs. After several postponements, the provincial government and the College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta set 2010 as the year when a degree will be required for ‘entry to practice’.\n\nDistance education was added to the mix, which enables students outside Alberta and even outside Canada to obtain a nursing degree from Athabasca University. Graduate programs have been available in the province since 1975 and the University of Alberta, for example, currently has eighty nurses enrolled in its Ph.D. program, enabling them to teach at the university level or to gain further knowledge in their particular specialties.\n\n",

      "title": "Early Associations: Nurses organize to improve their working lives",
      "article": "In the early days of lay nursing (as opposed to that of religious organizations), nurses worked on a freelance basis, as ‘private duty nurses’ usually in people's homes. That meant they had to negotiate their own wages and working conditions with individual families. Often that was difficult to do when nurses were faced with particularly hard-up families, who could barely afford to eat, let alone pay a nurse for her much needed care.\n\nIn 1916, the Alberta Association of Graduate Nurses became the Alberta Association of Registered Nurses or AARN. Nurses formed their organization to provide some sort of control over standards of nursing, and standards of training. In 1925, the AARN took the unprecedented step of limiting nurses' working days to twelve hours! Believe it or not, it had been twenty-four hours.\n\nDuring the Depression, because of the continuing difficulty of charging private families for nursing care, hospitals, doctors and governments took the opportunity to offer nurses an employment relationship with the hospitals. This proved to be quite a change and a challenge for the nurses. Difficulties arose as the two sides tried to sort out this new relationship, and labour management meetings were held to sort things out--usually on an individual basis, without the support of a collective group.\n\nBy 1941, a committee had been established by the AARN to improve the working conditions of both students and graduate nurses. It was called the Eight-Hour Day Committee, an item that was an important part of their agenda. In 1944, the newly formed Canadian Nurses Association (CNA) endorsed collective bargaining for nurses, supporting the position that the professional associations should act as bargaining agents. The AARN and the Alberta Hospital Association (AHA) met to discuss a minimum salary scale, hours of duty, vacation, sick leave, pensions and hospitalization.\n\nThe two groups continued to meet to discuss such matters and the AHA would issue recommendations for hospitals in respect to salaries and personnel policies--some hospitals would follow them and some wouldn't. At the same time, there were forty-four hour weeks and forty-eight hour weeks in different hospitals. Twenty hospitals were actually still using split shifts.\n\nThings shuddered along for several years and in 1961, in return for the government promise to introduce a pension plan, the nurses accepted salary terms that would see them fall behind both British Columbia and Saskatchewan. Under new legislation (1966), the Staff Nurse Associations within individual hospitals were allowed to be recognized as bargaining agents, although strike action was illegal, and, up to that point, forbidden by the CNA. The Provincial Staff Nurse Committee (PSNC) was formed within the AARN to take charge of collective bargaining.\n\nIn the early years of the seventies, the CNA lifted its ban on nurses' strikes and the AARN followed suit. When the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Saskatchewan Association of Registered Nurses was ineligible as a bargaining agent (because of the inclusion of traditional management positions), the way was paved for the establishment of independent labour unions for nurses.\n\n",

      "article": "One very important job for nurses, particularly in the early days of the province, was that of district or public health nursing. Beginning in 1919, a community could have a district nurse assigned to it if there were no other medical services within fifty or a hundred miles. The people of the community had to be able to provide the nurse with a cottage and they also had to supply furnishings and fuel for heating and cooking.\n\nThe provincial government paid the nurses' salaries but there was also a user fee (posted on the door of the cottage) of fifty cents for an office visit and one dollar for the first home visit. Along with this dollar the patient's family had to provide transportation to and from the homestead and the nurses had to take whatever transport was sent for them. It varied from horseback to buggy, from stoneboat to canoe, from snowshoes to dogsled and, by the fifties, airplane. One nurse, Laura Attrux, managed to obtain her pilot's licence so that she was ready to go to any emergency.\n\nAnother charge listed on the door was ten dollars for maternity care, a large amount of cash for many homesteaders in those days, but it included pre- and post-natal care for mother and baby, as well as the delivery. Some nurses already had midwifery training from England, and those who didn't were encouraged to take some obstetrical training whenever possible.\n\nBesides delivering babies, the nurses would find themselves doing everything from setting bones to pulling teeth. The strong link between the nurse and the Public Health Branch was important when she might have to deal with something she hadn't come across before--the advent of the telephone was indeed a godsend.\n\nIn 1924, travelling clinics became part of the landscape too. The district nurse would probably make an assessment at a school or group of schools in a community and recommend that some children by seen by the clinic. The community then got busy cleaning and disinfecting whatever building was to be used and all was made ready for the arrival of the team. The team usually consisted of twelve people--doctor, surgeon, two dentists, four nurses, one medical and one dental student, and, very important, two truck drivers. They brought all the equipment that might be necessary, although the community came up with as much as possible on their own. Depending on distances the clinic would often camp out at the community site. Besides dental work and any surgery the nurse had identified as necessary, parents generally brought their children to the clinic for check-ups and immunizations.\n\nLater on, in the fifties, when transportation was better and people weren't so isolated, the emphasis of public health was more on teaching. Miss Katie Brighty, who became the Superintendent of Public Health Nurses for Alberta, has more to say about that.",

      "article": "It is certainly one of the prettier settings for a hospital and perhaps it makes convalescing easier, but the medical care still has to be given. The earliest hospital in Jasper was a large tent on a wooden frame. There were only fifty or so people in the town by about 1913, and they were being served by two railway doctors coming from Pocohontas and Lucerne. Records also show that an isolation hospital existed in the teens and twenties that dealt with a flu epidemic in 1916 and scarlet fever a few years later.\n\nIt took increasing tourism and the president of the CNR to get things moving. After his tour of the West in the late 1920s, Sir Henry Thornton suggested to the medical personnel of Jasper that they investigate the possibilities of building a hospital. He put company money behind his suggestion and pledged twenty-five thousand dollars towards the cost of building and an annual grant of twenty-five hundred dollars towards its maintenance.\n\nThe hospital, originally known as St. Martha's opened at the end of January 1930. It was managed by four Sisters of Charity who came from Halifax. The name of the hospital was changed to Seton in honour of the foundress of their order. Operating the hospital was difficult in its early stages as the Depression took hold. The reduced taxes and extra loads of wood from the federal government were gratefully accepted.\n\nAs Jasper grew, so did the hospital. A second floor and extension were added in 1952, and another wing was added in 1964. Ownership had been turned over to the Sisters of Charity in 1953, but with health care re-organization, it became part of Jasper General Hospital District #87 in 1971. The following year the foundation was laid for a new hospital and the patients were moved into the new building in May of 1974. That new building was the winner of several architectural awards for its unique design.",

Before war was declared the Army Nursing Corps consisted of five nurses, but quickly grew to thousands in the first few weeks of the fighting. Approximately sixty-five of the Army Nursing Corps were from Alberta. Given the length of the journey from Alberta to the east coast, even to join up with the contingent going overseas, this is an amazing number. Most of them were graduates recruited directly from the schools of nursing.\n\nAt the beginning of World War I, nursing wasn't even a recognized profession that required registration. But by 1916, the Registered Nurses Act was passed that established a professional organization for nurses, the Alberta Association of Graduate Nurses.\n\nThe young women saw service in Canada at military bases but also served overseas in England and at battle stations in France. Casualty clearing stations were set up near the battle areas in order to determine the needs of each of the wounded or to treat them immediately. There were also mobile units that actually followed the soldiers to the front or moved them away to safer locations, if there were such places during the fighting. Of the Canadian nurses who went overseas, forty-six were killed - some when their hospitals were bombed, some on hospital ships that were torpedoed and some died of in the flu pandemic at the end of the war.\n\nA few years after they returned, the Alberta nurses formed the Overseas Nursing Sisters' Association, first in Edmonton and then in Calgary. It was a way of keeping in touch with those who had shared the same unforgettable experiences. A memorial for those who served overseas hangs in the medical building at the University of Alberta, while another was unveiled in 1926 at the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa.",

      "article": "By 1919, the branches of the Victorian Order of Nurses, while still serving the rural areas, were limited to Edmonton and Calgary, with an affiliation with High River and Athabasca. Only Edmonton and Calgary branches existed between 1921 and 1947. The midwifery issue had remained a concern, and in 1919, the VON permitted the nurses trained in obstetrics to practise midwifery in remote areas. Other midwives had been offering their services for many years before this.\n\nIn the early years of the century, there was a terrific population growth in Edmonton. With people often starting out in tents, there was a definite lack of water supply and sewage disposal and not enough physicians to meet medical needs. There were already hospitals in the city but very few nurses who would be able to help the sick in their homes. The VON was asked to help and the city granted enough money to hire one nurse. Only a few years later two more were added, one being stationed across the North Saskatchewan in Strathcona.\n\nIn 1914, based on the number of children being born in the city, a special nurse was hired to provide post-natal care to babies and their mothers, for up to a year following the birth. The VON was happy to report a major drop in the infant mortality rate from earlier years, and showed favourable comparison with the rest of the country.\n\nFunding was always a problem, especially during the Depression it was difficult to collect any kind of fee from destitute families who still needed the help of a nurse. The branch held tag days, organized rummage sales and bake sales, held dances and put on concerts. Sometimes they were able to persuade the better off to make a private donation.\n\nAnother problem for the nurses in Edmonton was accommodation. At one point some them shared an apartment with a housekeeper to take messages for them. Problems started when people, knowing where the nurses were, showed up at the apartment looking for medical help, no matter what the hour. Eventually, in 1930, office space was rented. And then, because the nurses were often visiting rural areas, there was the problem of transportation. The streetcar only went so far and the nurses had to make the best arrangements they could beyond that. In 1923, a car was purchased which alleviated the problem somewhat, but still left the others on the streetcar and anything else that was going their way. More cars did become available through the Kiwanis Club and the Lady Aberdeen League Auxiliary.",

Bishop Grandin immediately got in touch with the Grey Nuns in the little community of St. Albert and suggested that they take it on. He assured the physicians that she was an excellent manager and would pay off the money he would arrange to borrow for the building of the facility.\n\nLand was purchased from the Hudson's Bay Company and one thousand dollars was also pledged by the city council and the Edmonton General was on its way. The Grey Nuns were determined to treat all the sick who needed help whether they could pay or not. This resulted in a dispute with the physicians as they believed they should have the final say in who was admitted. The dispute escalated and had a lot to do with the fact that a second hospital was planned for Edmonton.\n\nBoyle Street Hospital, later known as the Royal Alexandra, and, to confuse the issue, also known as the Edmonton Public Hospital, began in an old frame house. But before it actually got going, a second Edmonton hospital was opened under the auspices of the Sisters of the Misericorde and thus the Misericordia Hospital. This again was at the request of the good bishop and began work in 1906. It was originally planned as a small maternity hospital for unwed mothers but became a general maternity hospital, away from the infectious diseases that were such a big part of the Edmonton General's cases. Then, quite quickly because the need was there, it began taking patients for general medical care.\n\nThese early nurses didn't just nurse. They took in boarders to help make ends meet, they planted a large garden for fresh food, and cared for domestic animals for milk and meat. They also gratefully accepted gifts of food from private citizens as well as a tax break from the city.\n\nAn isolation hospital was the fourth hospital in Edmonton, opening in a separate building on the grounds of the Edmonton Public (i.e. the original Boyle Street). The isolation hospital had an interesting early history as the nurses actually marched on city hall in 1913 in an uproar over wages, job descriptions, and working conditions. The Superintendent of Nurses was fired and the responsibility for the hospital was transferred from the Medical Officer of Health to a local board.\n\nStrathcona Hospital was built south of the river in 1906, with some funding from the Canadian Pacific Railway, in return for the medical care of its employees. Two years later the University of Alberta was started and it was decided that the medical school desired by Dr. Henry Marshall Tory should be built on the new campus.\n\nIn all these early hospitals, attempts were made to equip them properly and to use the most up-to-date methods of treatment; but for the nurses, it was their position on the frontier that shaped their jobs. Besides growing food, dealing with epidemics and working long hours, they also learned to improvise and to be inventive in their care. They came to be widely respected for the work that they did and the dedication that they showed.",

In 1916, the Graduate Nurses Act gave this body the responsibility for the registration of nurses.\n\nThe major concern of the Association for many years was the standard of education for student nurses. An amendment to the  1921 Act gave  the responsibility for setting and monitoring standards was given to the University of Alberta, and the Association (which had changed its name to the Alberta Association of Registered Nurses in 1920) continued to lobby for changes.\n\nIn 1932, the Weir Report recommended Canada-wide standards for the size of hospital that was required to support a School of Nursing, as well as increased training and education for nursing instructors at these schools. The minimum requirement for admission to the schools was recommended to be high school matriculation rather than Grade 8. These recommendations were strongly supported by the AARN but the changes were a long time in coming.\n\nExtreme shortages in the nursing field during the war encouraged the AARN to launch a recruiting campaign in 1943. It wasn't particularly successful, probably because of all the well-paid war-work that was available to young women at the time. The AARN also contacted married women who had resigned from their nursing positions because of their marriage.\n\nEducation and training of nurses continued to be an issue for the AARN and it continued to push for more formal education of nurses rather than using students to staff the hospital. The association proposed to establish a central training school as was the situation in Saskatchewan, but no funding was forthcoming from the government.\n\nIn 1967 the AARN developed a list of ‘delegated medical responsibilities’ in order to define which duties were in the nurses' realm and which were medical acts that should not be passed on to them. It served as a guide for hospitals and other organizations for many years, as techniques and practices became more complex.\n\nThe AARN was restructured in the sixties and by 1965 there were five full-time staff members to deal with the increasing activities and responsibilities of the Association. The following year an amendment to the Registered Nurses Act designated the AARN as the nurses' bargaining agent. The Association continued in this role until the formation of the United Nurses of Alberta as a separate bargaining unit in 1977.\n\nThe AARN continues to act on behalf of the nurses in their professional capacities. Their continued efforts in terms of legislation covering nursing regulations and professionalism resulted in the passage of the Nursing Profession Act in 1983 - finally legislating mandatory registration of nurses, a goal of the AARN for many years.\n\nIn 2005, that legislation was superceded by the Health Professions Act. This new governing law brought several changes to the professional association, including a name change to the College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta.",

Ross-Kerr noted in her excellent history of nursing in Alberta, Prepared to Care nurses banding together to protect themselves and their patients goes right back to the early days of the province.\n\nBy 1913, Edmonton and Strathcona had joined together to finance a separate isolation hospital for people stricken by some of the many contagious diseases like typhoid that were endemic. The isolation hospital was under the authority of the Medical Officer of Health. But a dispute over job descriptions and wages broke out between the Officer and the nurses at the hospital. The nurses marched to City Hall and met with the mayor. The conflict resulted in the firing of the superintendent of nurses and the hospital moving to the control of a municipal hospital board.\n\nEven earlier, in 1895, nurses provoked the province's first ‘medicare’ controversy at the Edmonton Grey Nuns, one of Alberta's first hospitals. Ross-Kerr points out that a dispute arose ‘relative to the professional relationship between the nuns and the physicians who cared for patients in the Hospital.’ The doctors of the hospital wanted to control when non-paying patients to the hospital should be admitted. They also wanted to not have to serve as physicians to these non-paying patients. The nuns, who of course served in the role of nurses, felt it their duty and right to admit patients who needed the care, whether they had money or not. The doctors said the nuns might ‘unknowingly admit an infections case to a public ward...’ but that argument was quickly debunked by a letter in a local newspaper by Father LeDuc. The nuns kept the right to admit patients.",

Although trained as a ‘domestic science instructor,’ MacAdams volunteered in the Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1916. It was while serving in England that she entered politics for the first time, running in the Alberta provincial election of 1917. At the time, she was overseeing the production of over 6000 meals a day for patients and staff at the Ontario Military Hospital in Orpington, England.\n\nHer striking election flyer has been preserved as a reminder of an effective political campaign. The flyer has a picture of a stern-faced MacAdams, in her military nursing uniform. It was evident she had decided to campaign on the natural sympathy for nurses at the time, asking military voters to: ‘Remember those who have helped you so nobly through the fight.’\n\nMacAdams election flyer: ‘Soldiers and Nurses from Alberta! You will have two votes at the forthcoming Election under the Alberta Military Representation Act. Give one vote to the man of your choice and the other to the sister. She will work not only for your best interests but for those of your wives, mothers, sweethearts, sisters and children after the war.

The soldiers were expected to vote Conservative.  So the Liberal government, rather than allowing them to vote in their home ridings, created two special MLA positions at-large, with the Alberta Military Representation Act. MacAdams topped the polls, defeating 19 male candidates in the vote. In the Legislature, she joined Louise McKinney - who had just been elected the first women in the Commonwealth a few months earlier in the general election.\n\nMacAdams became the first woman in the British Empire to introduce and successfully move a piece of legislation, the ‘Act to Incorporate the Great War Next-of-Kin Association.’\n\nAfter the war, MacAdams did not run for re-election in 1921.

Grande Prairie was to be the centre for a short winter course in various subjects of general interest and usefulness. I was to teach home nursing, bedside care and hygiene. This was my first teaching assignment since graduating from the Royal Alexandra Hospital, Edmonton.\n\nAt that time I knew nothing of the far-flung northern portion of the province. Sufficient that one battled with Edmonton's sub-zero temperatures in winter and fought its mosquitoes in summer. Going north was a completely new and exciting experience and with the ardor of youth I boarded that busy and friendly bi-weekly Northern Alberta Railway train. This railway had but little more than four years to its credit, with two northern terminals, one of which was at Grande Prairie and the other across the river north at Peace River Crossing. . . .\n\nIt could happen only once - that initiation of the first lecture - the first facing of a group of women. My white starched uniform covered shaking knees.\n\nHow attentive and interested those prairie wives and mothers were, plying me with questions and making suggestions arising from their own experiences. Many of these women, defying the elements, had travelled considerable distances to 'The Town' that they might attend this short course in household arts.\n\nThere was not a little amusement when the question of hygiene arose. It was then that I found myself in deep water, literally, when that old water pail with the family dipper hanging beside it, came under discussion--well! What was to be said about it? So to change the subject I started on what a friend of mine called 'outside inconveniences.' This simply ended in hilarious laughter. After that I confined my subjects to care of the patient in bed and simple home remedies.\n\nI could never forget them; a group of mature women, knowing far more of the vicissitudes of life than had touched me at the time. Some of these women many years before had travelled with their men in covered wagons, swaying to the awkward gait of oxen and lending a hand to help build a shelter on that wide beautiful prairie--dwellings filled with the warmth that only women dedicated to making a home could create.\n\nAn excerpt from, While Rivers Flow by Kate Brighty.",

      "article": "That winter (1919) was my introduction to rural life in Western Canada. During the round of the year I learned something of the struggle men and women endured to wrest from the land a clearing, to raise a dwelling and establish a home, eventually passing a legacy of forthright independence on to the next generation.\n\nIn that small Cottage Hospital, an unusually large new crop of babies kept us busy as bees. There were minor accidents, varying types of illnesses to cope with, calls from distances involving long drives, anxious moments searching for the right decision. One sustaining thought supported us through many difficulties. The Edmonton physicians, whom we seldom saw, gave us much reassuring advice. It was Dr. J.D. Harrison who said to me, ‘Remember, the telephone is at my bedside. Call me at any time during the day or night.’\n\nThat same winter, an urgent call came from the village of Lesser Slave Lake and although it was a long distance outside of my territory, who could refuse the need of a sick child?\n\nFortunately it was train day and I hurriedly packed my bag and shortly left on the eastbound train. I had no sooner arrived at Lesser Slave Lake when an Indian approached me, said he had come to take me to his friend's sick baby. Would I come with him at once?\n\nThe temperature had dropped to zero, a stiff wind was blowing off the lake and ‘nippy’ was the word for it. We cut across the corner of the frozen lake in the Indian's open, homemade cutter with his team of Indian ponies.\n\nI had had the good sense to wear moccasins, for with two pairs of woolen socks and moccasins large enough not to cramp the feet, there is no better way to keep the feet warm and comfortable in zero weather. . . .\n\nDuring the drive, Goosekeeper (for that was his name) gave me several words in Cree from which I listed a good-sized glossary. All of the words would be useful to me in my dealings with the Indians. The Cree vocabulary is simple and direct, making their language rather easy to learn.\n\nIn due time we reached a one-room log cabin that proved to be very comfortable. Inside, I found a young Indian woman bent over a cot where her sick son lay, a baby about sixteen months old. One glance at the small inert figure told me that the child was beyond human aid. The lamp of life was dim and as we watched, it flickered and went out.\n\nThe poor distraught mother was little more than a girl and I devoted my attention wholly to her. She was a woman who took pride in her household possessions; the polished kitchen range, the clean cooking utensils, the neatly curtained windows. But what surprised and interested me the most was a booklet on child welfare that lay on the table. Here, indeed, in this house more than the usual small comforts were to be found, while somewhere in the background there must surely be a husband who was a good provider. Together, in a mixture of Cree and English, we talked of many things, of Indian burial customs, of Christian rites, of the husband who was away on his trap-line, of the bereaved mother herself waiting for his return. . . .\n\nBeyond the small clearing, in the direction of a hill covered with lodge-pole pine, I saw a string of dogs weaving their way through the trees, drawing a heavily laden sleigh. A tall Indian ran beside the sleigh, urging the team of huskies into greater speed with voice and whip. The team swung around the building, coming almost to the door of the cabin where, red-eyed, footsore and utterly weary, the dogs dropped down on the snow. Still harnessed together, they curled up into furry balls, their noses tucked under their tails, and settled for a well-earned rest.\n\nThe Indian ducked his great height beneath the door and entered the house. Fearing to intrude on the grief of the bereaved parents, I stayed outside. At last, I opened the door, but the stricken man and women, bending over their beloved child in his small cot, took no notice of me. . . .\n\nIndian parents have a deep love for their children. Over the years I have seen much ignorance that led to sickness and, frequently. I have seen distress, but during my long association with the Indians I have never once seen an ill-treated child.\n\nAn excerpt from, While Rivers Flow by Kate Brighty",

      "article": "The first class of students for the three-year diploma program was admitted in 1923. Prior to this certificate courses had been offered to graduates of hospital training programs in order for them to specialize in public health. In 1923, also the option was given for nurses to enroll in the five-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The BScN program rules changed from time to time, but basically it was a combination of arts and science courses and actual hospital training, topped off with a final year leading to a specialization in public health nursing or teaching.\n\nThe first full-time Director of the School, Agnes Macleod, wasn't hired until 1936. It was under her guidance that the final or fifth year of the BScN was offered again at the University of Alberta--for several years before this, it had been necessary for students to finish their courses at the University of Toronto or the University of British Columbia. In 1996, the Universities Act made the U. of A. School of Nursing a free-standing academic unit, part of the university and the four-year Bachelor's program was implemented.\n\nA graduate program in nursing in Alberta was introduced in 1975 at the university. It enabled nurses to specialize in administration, or to obtain a certificate in such areas as advanced neonatal intensive care or midwifery. The Master of Nursing program adds flexibility in the response to new and specialized areas of work. The PhD program at the University of Alberta was the first of its kind in Canada, and it continues to prepare nurses for leadership roles - offering courses that test and develop nursing theory.\n\nMany changes have occurred over the years to the length and mode of delivery of nurses training. The University of Alberta Faculty of Nursing (given faculty status in 1976) has offered collaborative programs with hospitals and colleges in the Edmonton area and in 1990 began a five-year pilot program developed with Red Deer College, allowing students to complete the four-year BScN in Red Deer. All of these collaborations make it easier for young people not living in the major centres to take nurses' training if they so wish. Other collaborations with the University of Alberta Hospitals have offered a certificate program in neonatal nursing and nephrology since the 1980s. Emergency and intensive care nursing is also offered as an area of specialization.\n\nThe University of Alberta Faculty of Nursing continues to respond to new initiatives and to encourage its students to maintain a life-long learning approach to nursing. In 1998, the International Nursing Office (INO) was established to create an environment for international nursing initiatives. As part of the University's goal of internationalization, a major objective of the INO is to become a center for knowledge development and mutual capacity building in international/multicultural health and nursing. One major goal of the University's International Office is the facilitation of innovative learning and research opportunities for the University and its partner institutions. Another major goal is to assist students to understand global issues by participating in educational opportunities abroad.",

A woman's hair, up until the flapper era, had been considered her ‘glory’ - the longer and thicker the better. In the 1920s, however, the fashion changed drastically and the ‘bob’ was now the thing. A ‘bob’ was a short blunt cut that actually showed the young woman's neck - although when you think about it, upswept hairdo's had always exposed the neck. The older generation was not impressed and did their best to curtail such goings on.\n\nIn the 20s, young nurses in Calgary were swept up by the fashion and quickly discovered the ‘moral constraints’ that nurses were expected to live with. Two students at the Holy Cross Hospital in Calgary went out on a limb and had their hair bobbed. They were immediately dismissed from the school. This precipitated a crisis. In a show of solidarity several of their classmates also cut their hair short and nineteen more young ladies were asked to leave the nursing profession.\n\nProbably realizing that they were fast losing their worker bees, the administration allowed the students (other than the original two) to return to work, but with the loss of their weekly time-off for three months - a period in which the short hair was supposed to grow back to an acceptable length. A few months later a ‘bobbing’ weekend was held and sixty nurses cut their hair. The Holy Cross Hospital gave up and submitted to the inevitable.   The first two daring students, however, never returned.\n\n",

They were busy treating patients in their homes and trying to halt the spread of the disease. Other epidemics in later years had to be dealt with too; smallpox, diphtheria, typhoid and scarlet fever all showed up in the province at some point.By the mid-1920s, most of the post-natal work had been taken over by government agencies and more emphasis was placed on education and particularly preventive nursing care. The branch began giving fieldwork training for hospital nursing students, as well as home-birth training for medical students.The emphasis changed again during the Depression when the nurses moved almost entirely from bedside nursing to relief work. Since it had remained a voluntary organization that did its own fund-raising, the hard times required the flexibility to do what was necessary as nursing fees were few and far between. They spent a lot of time collecting food and clothing and distributing it to those they knew were in need. By the late 1930s, things had switched back to bedside nursing and they found their patients to be pretty evenly divided among maternity and infants, medical and surgical, and chronic and communicable diseases.\n\nWorld War II changed things again and the VON nurses spent a great deal of time visiting soldiers' wives and young families. Later on there were still a lot of night calls to peoples' homes to administer drugs and change dressings and catheters and they continued to do pre-natal care and classes, often working with other agencies. Sharing their knowledge and experience of home nursing with hospital trained student nurses remained a part of their mandate too.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Edmonton hospitals began a referral program for the VON nurses to assist with discharge care, making acute care beds available more quickly. Perhaps one of the most well known services that the VON was asked to take on was the Meals-On-Wheels program. Originally seen as a need by some church organizations, they lobbied the provincial Department of Social Services for funds. The service began in 1968 with a number of different organizations preparing the food. Packaging was designed with the help of a former board member and volunteers delivered the hot food to those who were not able to prepare meals for themselves. The program is still in existence today as an independent organization.\n\nOther work has involved the Edmonton branch with the Women in Crisis project and the WIN house, a shelter for battered women. The ever-flexible group also began the operation of an adult day care centre to provide services to the frail and elderly.\n\n",

      "article": "by Jo-Ann Korosi\n\n\n\nMy parents had 4 children by the time Gwen came to Craigmyle, Alberta, my older brother and 3 sisters. My father had had a terrible experience with his smallpox vaccination when he was a boy so he did not allow his children to be vaccinated. As a result, they all came down with whooping cough at the same time. They ranged from two years to five years of age. All of the children were very ill and my parents had moved the children from their bedrooms to the living/dining room so they were never out of my parents' sight.\n\nWhooping Cough in the late forties was very serious and could kill. When my siblings went in to their coughing fits my parents had to rush to their sides to sit them up and pound their backs to loosen the phlegm as they were too weak to cough without sitting up. Our District Health Nurse, Gwen Derry came and stayed with my parents - only leaving when she had to. Along with my parents, she nursed these children day and night.\n\nGwendolyn Mary White was born and raised in Edmonton. She graduated from the University of Alberta Hospital with a Bachelor of Science in 1939 and became a nurse with the Victorian Order of Nurses. In the early years of World War II she joined the Royal Canadian Air Force as a nursing sister. Gwen White came to Craigmyle after the war to serve as the District Health Nurse. These nurses cared for the whole community during a time when there was no public health care insurance. Visits to the doctor were rare because of the expense. It was the District Health Nurse you went to if you were sick. She would decide if you needed to see a doctor. While serving as the District Health Nurse, Gwen met and married Jack Derry and they raised their two sons.\n\nSo it was that Gwen Derry was there when my siblings were so dreadfully sick. One night things reached the crisis and she told my mother she had done all she could and that they would know by midnight how things were going to go. Gwen stayed with them all and around midnight the older children had started to breath easier. The two-year-old was very frail. My Dad was holding her up in the rocking chair. She had coughed so hard that when she was sat up to get rid of the phlegm, the blood ran out of her mouth. My parents were sure they would lose her but a little later, with Gwen by her side, she let out a big sigh and started to breath more easily. They all survived and are still alive today.\n\nEvery year after that my father bought Gwen Derry a dozen red roses at Christmas. That was no small feat in the winter in Craigmyle during the 40's, 50's and even the 60's. No words were ever spoken of debt but my parents knew very well they owed their childrens' lives to Gwen Derry. And all of the children were given their dreaded 'shots' after that.\n\nThis story in itself would be an inspiration but it continues. Gwen Derry cared for her whole community and was probably it's most important citizen. She didn't even stop when her job was cut. She was always available for nursing advice.\n\nWhen I was in grade nine and having trouble in science she tutored me. I passed my grade nine departmental exam. That was in 1968 and during her lessons she told me I should go into computers, as this was the wave of the future. (How smart she was.) I forgot that advice, finished high school, got married and had 2 children. When I traveled to Hanna (where Gwen had moved) the first time after my children were born, I had to go and show her my babies. When I walked in the door, she took them from my arms, laid them on the dining room table, stripped their clothes off and did a full assessment, pronounced them sound and wrapped them up and gave them back to me. Then came the questions to make sure I knew what the heck I was doing.\n\nYears later when Gwen passed away my family was all there to say good bye (even though my brother and sisters had scattered across North America). It was standing room only at the funeral and her casket was so covered with a blanket of red roses that you could barely see it. She is buried in the Field of Honour in the Hanna Cemetery. Gwen Derry embodied everything that nursing is and hopefully ever will be. She was an intelligent, skilled practitioner who cared deeply about her patients and her community and never stepped back from a challenge. She did not ask for praise or recognition - she just did what good nurses do every day. This story is a tribute to her so that nurses can know they come from a very powerful and important tradition and to be a NURSE is no small thing.\n\n\n\nFootnote: When I called one of Gwen's sons to get as many facts as I could for this story, he told me she had never spoken of all the nursing care she gave and never knew why my Dad bought his Mom roses every year for Christmas.\n\n",

Four thousand Canadian nurses served during the war.\n\nWhen Canadian nurses were sent to Sicily after the invasion of Italy, Agnes MacLeod of Edmonton was matron of the battlefield hospital. Other nurses tell of arriving in England in 1940 at the height of the Blitz, surviving on very little sleep and wartime rations, while still putting in twelve hour days with very few hours off in a week or a month.\n\nAnd, of course, getting there was 'half the fun'--extended ocean voyages while their convoy of ships zig-zagged across the Atlantic in an attempt to avoid German submarines. Terror combined with seasickness must have made them glad to disembark even if it was in England's blackout.\n\nThe Alberta nurses signed on in either Calgary or Edmonton, shipped out pretty quickly to England and Africa to begin with and were later moved to the battlefields in all areas of the conflict. They had to be between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-six, single or widowed with no children, and a registered graduated of a school of nursing. They also had to be in good physical shape and pass an exam set by the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps.\n\nHospital ships were a possible location, especially in the Mediterranean, the large red crosses indicating their mission not always protected from German subs or bombs. So-called 'clearing stations' by definition fairly close to the battlefront were right in the line of fire too. In spite of the danger and lack of equipment and supplies, nurses and other medical personnel handled hundreds of incoming wounded, endeavouring to get to the most seriously wounded first. The same nurses would staff the operating room.\n\nThe nurses who served in the military forces were given the title of nursing sisters and during the war were given the rank of commissioned officers. But the workload didn't lessen. Nursing Sister Jessie Morrison spoke of the 1944 push to learn how to pitch tents and dig latrines in preparation for the invasion of France. They left their dress uniforms in the cupboard and were issued khaki pants and shirts and heavy boots.\n\nOne of the offshoots of wartime nursing was exposure to new and innovative techniques, unfortunately made necessary by the horrible wounds that had to be treated. Burn therapy and neurological procedures were particularly important. The experiences of these women during World War II drastically changed nursing and the perception of nursing--the admiration and gratitude of all those who came in contact with them was not forgotten.\n\n\n\n",

She joined the Royal Canadian Army Corps in May of 1940 and was placed in charge of one of the casualty clearing stations in Dorking, in the south of England. Just over a year later she was appointed Matron of the Canadian Neurological Hospital in Basingstoke. That position held the rank of Captain and by the end of the war she had been promoted to Major.\n\nWhen Miss MacLeod returned to Canada after the war, another promotion made her Matron in Chief at the Department of Veteran's Affairs in Ottawa.\n\n",

There are twelve airplanes and two helicopters contracted to Alberta Health and Wellness and their services can be arranged by a doctor, a hospital or local emergency medical staff.\n\nAs part of the air medical crew, flight nurses work with flight paramedics and flight physicians to provide the best care they can until the patients arrives at the designated hospital. This includes treating patients before they are air-lifted as well as, looking after them on the flight.\n\nThe nurses are experienced, Registered Nurses with backgrounds in Emergency Department, Intensive Care Unit, Critical Care Unit or Cardiac Care Unit environments. They usually continue to work at their home base while being available to treat and accompany patients whenever necessary. They also take extra training for the emergency care they have to give under sometimes trying circumstances - minimum training requirements include additional certification in Advance Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) or Basic Trauma Life Support (BTLS) is also required.\n\nAnd, as do firefighters, nurses involved in such an emergency environment, have to be physically fit in order to deal with a variety of possibly strenuous situations.\n\nThere are bases for these air ambulance flights throughout the province, most stations are in the north because of the lack of alternative transportation\n\n",

      "title": "One nurse’s long career, Hazel Paish, RN",
      "article": "Hazel Paish saw huge changes during her very long career in nursing.  She began as a district nurse on horseback and by the time she was done, she was working with electronic monitors and serving on a provincial nurses’ negotiating committee.\n\nHazel was born in 1919 in Empress, Alberta and when World War II broke out she was in nursing school at the Edmonton General.  She’d gone into nursing despite the objections from her parents who didn’t want her to go into nursing because, as she says, “I’d see what a man looked like without his clothes on.”  But she had worked for $5 a month; until she had saved up the $50 she needed for nursing school.  The school used the $50 to pay for any breakages and costs but by the time she was finished Hazel had enough left to pay for her graduation gown.\n\nJust a couple of years later, still during the War, Hazel began as a district nurse at Blueberry Mountain near Spirit River in northern Alberta.\n\nWhen she arrived in the north, Hazel recalled having a humorous experience with wildlife: “We had to carry the water about half a mile, and I went out the first morning to get a pail of water and I saw this animal standing across the dugout. It didn’t look like a horse or a cow and I dropped the pails and ran.  The storekeeper laughed his head off. He said ‘that’s a moose.’”\n\nShe attended most of the births in the district and helped many children come into the world. She did it all without the benefit of a telephone or easy access to a doctor. The nurse handed out the pills herself, including narcotics.  But Hazel remembers the strict limits on nursing:\n\n\n\n“We weren’t allowed to freeze for suturing, but we could suture without freezing.  The blacksmith donated a set of dental tools so we were able to pull teeth… but without freezing.”\n\n\n\nShe asked around whether the children had been inoculated, and they had not.  So she made it a point to go to each of the five schools on horseback.  Because she had to give a separate inoculation for each disease, it took two months of travelling.  The eastern section of the district was Ukrainian, Blueberry Mountain itself was very English, and the outlying area was all aboriginal. \n\nIn that part of the country the people were quite poor, Hazel recalls, and the district nurse’s work had a full range of responsibilities, including handing out the welfare which was a ration of food, such as so many pounds of potatoes and apples each week.\n\nHazel got married to a Ukrainian farmer in 1945, in Grande Prairie. She stopped nursing and went farming.  They raised 13 kids on the farm. It was a team effort she recalls: “I had to drive the tractor and help with the sawing of the wood, clearing brush and all that kind of stuff.”\n\nIt wasn’t’ until 25 years later, in 1969, that Hazel went back to nursing, this time at the hospital in  Grande Prairie. She still had seven kids at home. It was simple economics that took her back to work. “We were getting more and more broke with the hail storms and the freezing and everything.”\n\nReturning to nursing after so many years proved to be interesting for Hazel. “ I’d been there four or five days and they had just gotten a heart monitor. Everyone was going off to dinner and they said watch the heart monitor that it doesn’t go to a straight line.  Thank goodness it didn’t happen.”\n\nHazel chose to work in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). She remembers using electroshock paddles, a new technology she was quite suspicious of.\n\n“The first time I did have to use them… we called the doctor but he was a long ways away.  Another nurse helped me and I asked ‘do you know to use this thing?’ She said ‘I don’t know anything about it.  Who’s going to hold the paddles and who’s going to press the button…we’ll see what happens.’  We tried it; I really thought it was something to make people think something was being done.  Nothing happened.  Just as I’d thought.  ‘You are supposed to do it three times,’ she said, ‘so, let’s try it again.’ She pressed the button, and this time the most beautiful pattern came on the screen and we saved a life.”\n\nHazel soon became involved in larger nursing issues. The Alberta Association of Registered Nurses AARN asked her to be the district information officer and she put out a newspaper for the north.  “I had five kids at home, and they helped me with the Gestetner.  I put a few poems in that I thought were apt for nursing in each paper.”\n\nShe also joined UNA when it started and she was still working for the AARN.  She became president of her UNA Local.\n\nAt one point she published one of the AARN newsletters with a financial statement but the AARN had concerns with it.  She left the AARN position and, Hazel says “then I went whole hog UNA and I was president of the local and then of the district. There were 13 hospitals up here and we used to go to a different hospital meeting each month. Most of us traveled in one vehicle. We had a Volkswagen van and we would try to find a hotel where everyone could sleep in one room to save money.”\n\nShe was elected to several UNA provincial negotiating committees and the provincial executive board.  In 1988, she was on the negotiating committee during the 19-day illegal strike.\n\nHazel still had many more years of nursing ahead of her. She and her husband had divorced and she had moved to High Prairie where she was nursing when she turned 65. The hospital “retired” her, against her wishes and Hazel and UNA took the issue to court and finally won on appeal. \n\n“I got eight months pay and my job back again, but I had to work on maternity and I hadn’t worked maternity since my training days. I didn’t know anything about the fetal monitor and the incubator and I was afraid I’d make a mistake. It was all this technical stuff.”\n\nShe also was not well welcomed back in the facility, so she finally quit and moved to Grande Prairie where she had bought a house. But she soon found she did not have enough to keep her busy so she took a job at the Central Park Lodge long-term care facility. Hazel worked there until she was 75, older than many of the residents she worked with.\n\nToday (2006) Hazel lives in Spirit River and took time out from picking her saskatoons “before the birds get them” to tell her story.\n\n",

      "article": "It wasn't until Dr. Jonas Salk's vaccine was perfected in 1954 that poliomyelitis was virtually eradicated from the western world. Before that it was a terrifying and dreaded disease that seemed to come out of nowhere to attack children. An early epidemic in 1927/1928 led to the establishment of a polio hospital in Edmonton, but Alberta was still one of the hardest hit provinces in the 1935 epidemic.\n\n\n\nDoreen Olmsted who was nursing in Saskatchewan explains: I was working on the neurology ward then. They came to us, and it was absolutely horrible. I remember people coming in, babies, some of the dying. We really weren't prepared at all. The wards weren't set up properly. Instead of having them together in a room, they were all separated. There were a lot of private rooms there. The iron lungs were being used, the old iron lungs, all that stuff. That was scary. There were some very sad cases there.\n\n\n\nThe mechanical device that came to be known as the iron lung wasn't invented until 1930 and not widely used until seven or eight years later. When chest paralysis occurred, the iron lung breathed for the patient, very often a young one, either by use of a motor or a hand pump system. The main problem in the beginning was getting the huge piece of equipment manufactured (and paid for) when an epidemic suddenly required many of them at once.\n\nDuring the last epidemic in Alberta (1953-1954), nurses found themselves learning how to use the machine. It created a lot of heavy work for them as it involved complete body care and hygiene for immobilized patients. Caring for these patients also meant exposing themselves to the disease. Another problem that came up during the use of all these life-saving machines was that they ran on electricity--power failures were a nightmare for the patients and the hospital staff. Since the iron lungs had to be operated manually in an emergency, the nurses were generally told to run to the polio ward if the lights went out.\n\n\n\nJean Shafto remembers that polio patients were brought in to the Banff Hospital: Then we had polio patients, because in the early '50s when the polio epidemic came, they had mineral spring waters there and a physiotherapy department, and we had an iron lung.\n\n\n\nApproximately fourteen hundred people were affected by polio in Alberta, including the nurses who contracted the disease while looking after their young patients. The residual effects are still being felt today, fifty years after recovery. Post-polio syndrome, involving muscle weakness and joint pain, has become widely known.\n\n",

      "article": "The plans for the new hospital to be built in 1954 at one point included busing the student nurses from the old residence to the new hospital location. Since the old residence was overcrowded anyway, it was decided to seek approval to raise funds for a new one.\n\nThe new building was a spread-out ranch style with bedrooms in the end wings and classrooms and lounges in the centre core. When those winter winds whipped across the prairies, the young students must have really appreciated the fact that it was connected to the hospital by a tunnel. Actual moving-in day with all its chaos was January 22nd. 1958.\n\nThe girls were kept strictly in their own groups. Probationers, affectionately known as probies, and juniors, intermediates and seniors were often housed in different areas of the residence and ate at different tables, depending on where they were in the hierarchy.\n\nOne special person in the students' lives had to be the housemother, who sat at the front desk, noting comings and goings (especially those after curfew), sorting mail and delivering messages to the girls, and keeping track of any visitors. She might have been seen as a jailer, but usually became more of a grandmother, overlooking the occasional slip-up on the part of her girls.\n\nRoom and board were provided free of charge to the nursing students, laundry was looked after and, other than making their own beds and keeping their rooms tidy, the girls were not responsible for general cleaning. In spite of their long days in the wards, it probably was quite a bonus to some of the girls from farm backgrounds, who would have worked extremely hard at the never-ending chores at home.\n\nCurfews and late leave regulations didn't change much over the years until the more relaxed years of the 1960s came along. The students, after their initial six months of training, could stay out as late and as often as they liked--as long as they noted their time of return on a sign-in card. They could even stay out overnight if they filled out a card with the address of where they were staying.\n\nSince the students really were an important part of the actual staff of the hospital, arrangements for Christmas and other holidays had to be made. As many patients as were able to go were sent home, but, even with that reduction in numbers, most of the students were required to work at least part of the holiday. The hospital board provided a turkey dinner and other organizations brought decorations and entertainment. Very often the nurses formed their own choir and sang Christmas carols throughout the hospital for those patients who couldn't manage to go home. For many of the students it would have been their first Christmas away from home.\n\nAs standards changed over the years, many assessments had pointed to inadequate teaching facilities and insufficient numbers of qualified teaching staff. The move to the new nurses' residence in 1958 addressed the facilities problem to a certain extent, but in 1963 a special committee from the University of Alberta ranked the school 'last' in the twelve schools throughout the province. It was thought that closure was imminent, but a reprieve was organized. To allow time to bring things up to date, it was decided that there would be no intake class that fall (1963). Upsetting as this was to all concerned, most particularly to the young women who had applied and been accepted for that year, the decision was firm.\n\nThe next few years under a newly appointed Director of Nursing Education (for the first time a separate position from that of Director of Nursing) worked well. The vacant instructional positions were filled and new classes of students were taken in the following years. But changes were occurring outside the control of the Medicine Hat School of Nursing--a trend towards two-year diploma courses at other educational institutions was the major one. The hospital Board decided to talk with the equivalent institution in Medicine Hat, the Medicine Hat Junior College. Finding that plans were already afoot to begin a similar two-year diploma course, the hospital agreed to provide the practical training that would be part of the course.\n\nThere was, of course, lots of opposition to closing the school, not the least of which came from the existing students. They were well taken care of--the seniors and intermediates would finish their years at Medicine Hat School of Nursing, graduating in October of 1970 and 1971, and the juniors would be transferred to the Galt School of Nursing in Lethbridge. The juniors and seniors finished out those years at Medicine Hat School of Nursing, rattling around in the 'new' residence that had been designed for a hundred and five students--they even had their housemother.\n\n",

The practice of  psychiatric nursing,  which was developed in the first half of the twentieth century, played a significant part in contemporary  understanding of mental illness.\n\n The Provincial Hospital for the Insane was opened at Ponoka on July 4, 1911. The 1921  report by the  National  Committee for Mental Hygiene, noted that '...while nurses are  faithful in their conduct  of duties, there is urgent need for the establishment of a training school'. In 1931, Dr. Charles Barrager, the Medical  Superintendent who had  previously worked at  Brandon, Manitoba, opened the training school  at Ponoka. In 1948, a class of 18 psychiatric nurses graduated  from the three-year course at the Provincial Mental  Institution at Oliver. The male graduates  were known as Certified Attendants; the female graduates as Graduate Mental Nurses.\n\nPsychiatric nurses held an important meeting on April 11, 1950, at Ponoka, with representatives from the Alberta  Institute Oliver.   Ted James was elected as the first President of the Alberta Psychiatric  Nurses Association and, on May 1,  1950, the  APNA was officially registered under the  Societies Act. The Psychiatric Nursing  Training Act was  passed in 1955 and, in 1963; the Psychiatric Nurses' Act of Alberta came into being. In that same  year, the name of the  Association was changed to the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Alberta (PNAA).   In 2005, with the new Health Professions Act the professional association also took on a new name the College of Registered Psychiatric Nurses of Alberta (CRPNA).\n\n(Information from the CRPNA).\n\n",

      "article": "The name Winnifred Stewart is synonymous with helping mentally handicapped children. For thousands of families with mentally handicapped children, she helped turn despair, frustration and social stigma into hope, understanding and community acceptance.\n\nStewart's family moved to Edmonton from British Columbia when she was a small child and, after finishing high school, she took her training as a Registered nurse at Edmonton General Hospital. Motivated by a desire to help her son Parker, who was born severely mentally handicapped, she devoted twenty years to experimental research into the methods of teaching the mentally handicapped. Observing the level of development that Parker obtained, Stewart became convinced that schools for the mentally handicapped were not only possible, but essential.\n\nIn the 1950s, Winnifred Stewart managed to arouse the interest of the provincial government in providing financial aid to schools for these children and then put her efforts into establishing the first association for teachers of the mentally handicapped. In 1954, she was the first woman to address the Alberta Legislature from the floor of the House. This resulted in the first recognition by a government in Canada to provide financial aid to schools for mentally handicapped children.\n\nDuring the period from 1954 to 1970, Winnifred Stewart organized and founded schools for the mentally handicapped in nineteen communities across Western Canada. All these schools use the curriculum and teaching methods developed by Stewart for which she is internationally recognized.\n\nStewart worked closely with the University of Alberta regarding the mentally handicapped, providing a practical workshop for research projects. She also established a working relationship with forty-five school divisions within the province that have children attending the Winnifred Stewart School. Persevering in urging the Edmonton Association to establish a Vocational Training Sheltered Workshop for the mentally handicapped, Stewart saw the realization of that dream with the opening of Cerwood Industries in 1979.\n\nIn 1972, Winnifred Stewart was named an Officer of the Order of Canada, and in the same year received an Honourary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the University of Alberta.\n\n",

These recruitment efforts have contributed quite considerably to the multicultural nature of our country and of the health work force.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s a large number of nurses came to Canada from the Caribbean, from Jamaica, Trinidad, Grenada and other countries. The nurses found a welcoming environment in the Canadian health system.\n\nMany Caribbean nurses also went to the United Kingdom, which actually sent a good number of nurses to Canada as well.  After the war Canada recruited many British nurses. The international nature of the nursing workforce means that nurses from the British Isles still move here to this day to pursue their careers.\n\nIn the 1960s and the 1970s – and up until the present – Canada has welcomed a large number of nurses from the Philippines. Prior to the 1960s, there were fewer than 200 Filipino immigrants living in Canada. By 1973, the Philippines had become the seventh largest source country of immigration overall. Many of the Filipinos who immigrated to Canada during this period came as doctors and nurses. Filipino nurses also migrated in large numbers to the United States, so much so that there have been complaints about the exodus within the Philippines’ health system.\n\nThe influx of nurses from other countries has contributed greatly to a multiethnic workforce in the Canadian health care system.\n\n",

Its first matron was Sophie Ann Kettleson, formerly Buchanan, and she recalled a case near Bruderheim early in her career. After nursing three sick children for a month, she was paid--one cow and its calf. When the dust settled, she had paid seven dollars for trucking, had sold the cow, and ended up with four dollars and the calf. As Sophie said, 'She was good beef, too.'\n\nSophie was a real westerner, born in Fort Saskatchewan in 1909. Times were hard and everything, including their clothes, seemed to be made from flour sacks. Sophie left home in 1927 to begin her nurses' training at Misericordia Hospital in Edmonton.\n\nTwenty years later when Sophie and her husband moved together to Edmonton, Sophie began working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Eventually, in 1964 she moved over to the Norwood Auxiliary Hospital. As Matron of a usually under-funded institution, Sophie Kettleson pulled out all the stops to look after her patients whatever their needs were--even roping her sister, Roma into giving 'cuts and perms' to the residents who couldn't get out to the beauty parlour. Roma remembers that Sophie didn't waste anything and neither, under her watchful eye, did her staff. John Gillese explains it, 'The West left its influence on their generation: everyone was a neighbour. And the hard times left a legacy of resourcefulness and richness, too. What you had to do, you did. And you did it because those for whom you laboured were, or might have been, your neighbours.'

Her family arrived from Ireland in 1926 when she was three and her childhood years were spent in an environment with very little money.  The fact that everyone else was poor may have helped, but she still learned to be part of a family team -  working all the hours God gave to keep food on the table and shoes on the feet.\n\nThe home nursing care provided by Tena’s mother when any of the children were sick likely influenced the woman when she chose a career in nursing.  However, a bout with appendicitis when she was a teen, introduced her to Alice Keith, the matron of the Vermillion Hospital who helped her to make up her mind.\n\nFinishing her training, Tena worked in a variety of situations--the Vegreville Hospital where she had trained, as the only staff person in the coal-mining town of Mountain Park, private nursing, teaching. In 1964, she joined the staff at the Norwood Auxiliary Hospital. It was a time when the focus for long term care was changing from custodial care to quality of life care, and nurses like Tena Lyndon made it happen.\n\nUnder Sophie Kettleson, by that time matron at Norwood, Tena was able to let loose all that compassion she had for the elderly or the injured. Only two years later she was asked to be matron of the newly opened Lynwood unit. Friends and colleagues talk about the eighteen-hour days she worked and the continuous efforts she made to improve the quality of the residents' lives. Raising funds was something she was particularly good at and when the Edmonton Police Association donated a wheelchair accessible bus to take residents to special events and outings, they called the bus, 'Tena's Dream.'\n\nMany of the things that Sophie Kettleson and Tena Lyndon did for 'their' residents have come to be part of what's expected at other long-term care facilities. Even as cutbacks and tight budgets have strained resources in these facilities, there are other Sophies and Tenas who are giving their patients the quality of life they deserve.\n\nFrom People and Progress by John Patrick Gillese\n\n",

      "article": "Margaret Ethier was the President of the United Nurses of Alberta from 1980 to 1988.\n\n\n\nI actually thought about being a doctor. This was in the '50s. I really didn't know what nurses or doctors did anyway except from reading books. But I wouldn't have had the money to go to university. The nursing school I selected, at that time most of the nursing schools were hospital based. They had a training program. You studied a little bit and worked on the floor. In fact, they counted on the nursing students for staff. In fact I think that's what quite a bit of the change was with being short staffed, was that when the nursing students eventually started going into university and colleges, they weren't there as workers. That made quite a crunch on the health care system.\n\nI chose the Nova Scotia hospital, which was a mental hospital. It would be like the Alberta Hospital here. I chose that because they paid you a stipend, maybe $50 a month or something. The other ones didn't pay you, but they weren't like now where you had to pay a tuition to go in. I guess they recognized the fact that they needed the students to do the work. The usual complement of a floor at that time, even at the VG which is where we affiliated in Halifax, the big general hospital, the complement would be two RNs. One would be the head nurse, the other was the assistant head. One of them worked the weekend and the other one had the weekend off. The rest of the staff was students, as well as some licensed practical nurses. Then on evenings, when you were a junior student you were in charge on nights. When you were an intermediate student, which would be the 2 nd year, you're in charge on evenings. Then in your third year you could be...So that's how they worked it. You worked as staff, and depending on what year you were in, you'd also be in charge on evenings and nights. But that was a mental hospital. That's what I went into. Because of the money. Because they paid you to go there. I didn't have any money. It wasn't that much, but they gave you free room and board plus $50 or $60 a month.\n\nI went in to training in 1960. I'd finished my schooling, grade 11 anyway, in '57 or '58. Worked for a year and went into nursing...\n\nThey had locked wards. They would take the students on a tour of the hospital. I'm sure they liked to do that. They liked to scare us. Hi Jenny, how are you? It was, screw you, I'll kill you, and all this. It was like One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. A lot of that stuff was true. The wards were all locked. We didn't have any open wards...\n\nThey locked them all up. They were just going into psychiatric drugs at that time. It was a changeover going from the '50s to the '60s. They still had a lot of these treatments, like for schizophrenics where they'd give them a high dose of insulin and put them into insulin shock and let them sleep. The things they did. There was a lot of electrical shock. They had a whole ward for that. We had the isolation rooms, all of that. You locked them up until they smartened up.\n\nWhat I remember is that the nursing model was based on a military model. ...The attitude there was we were kind of the lowest of the low. You had 3 levels. There was the probie, the probationer that had 6 months. You were nothing. They would be what is termed abusive to you now, which pretty well they are in military training too. You'd be walking along and they'd say, How are you today Ms. Woodberry? Fine. You're going to work? Ya. Do you notice anything untoward about your appearance? What do you see there? What's wrong with those shoes? You are given a stipend at this hospital, are you not? And how much is that? And how much does shoe polish cost? We were scared to death. I never learned anything till I graduated, to be truthful. I was scared to death of my instructors all the time.\n\nRemember we were only 17 years old. We had a lot of energy, though. So anyway, you were asking about the attitudes. We lived in a dormitory. The attitude of the military, as I was saying, is that the lowest of the low was a probie. After 6 months you got your cap, then you became junior, which was a step up. Then there was the intermediate. We opened the doors. We stood for any level above us. We did not go in the door first. You opened the door for the juniors, etc.\n\nThey didn't have people to supervise what you did. They were just interested in supervising like if there was a catheterization to be done somewhere, or a dressing. Because we didn't have that many as a medical floor. But the rest of the time we just basically worked, we were the staff there. It was kind of fun. It was hard work, but it was fun. But it really was training. It was kind of like boot camp, so you got together and became a cohesive group as you moved through your years.\n\nWe weren't allowed to make mistakes. Now you can make a mistake and you get a warning. You'd be out of there. In that probation year you had to make 75% or something. They'd say, look around you, this is how many is in your class. There'll only be half left. They liked to scare the hell out of the new people.\n\n\n\nThank you to the Alberta Labour History Institute for use of this interview.\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "RN Judy Blakely nursed in Ontario and British Columbia and in Hinton in Alberta. In Alberta, you don't go under the health auspices [health system] until you are long-term care, extended care. And prior to that you're under the ministry of housing, which is quite different that you'd find in a British Columbia system. Even in the staff, you find that the staff in British Columbia are wearing uniforms. The staff in housing, which is more geared toward being a residential setting, again providing basically the same kind of care, but different ways of dealing with it. So the girls aren't in uniform in a lot of cases. They're not in blue jeans, but they're not in, they sort of represent more, this is our home rather than this is an institution. Quite a difference.\n\nGenerally when you're in a seniors lodge it's PCAs, which is personal care attendants. They do receive some training, but they do not have the designation of the LPN, or in other provinces it's RNA, this type of thing. They do have some education, but not as elaborate. The other thing is that they're not doing hands-on nursing care. They are the people who support everything else except for personal care, and then you have your LPNs and RNs coming in from home care services, which are community-based nursing service run under the health units.\n\nI do want to make sure that the staffing is staying. As we find that we're progressing through a lot of these issues, costs seem to be a big factor. If costs are being taken up by staffing, you see some reduction in the staffing. We're already running, in a lot of cases that I've been involved with, right at the bottom level of how much staff there is. When the regulations say you can have one person on a night shift for x number of residents, that's all you have. 'Cause that's all you can afford to have. In a lot of cases, one person isn't enough. So we really have to have people that are committed to this type of work, because it is a 24-7 work. But we also have to have the means financially to be able to have these people in place. I think that's very important. The other thing that comes into play, especially if you're in a rural or outlying district, you have to have the inspections. You have to have the accessibility to good food at a reasonable cost so you can keep your costs down, and again give the best service that you possibly can to the seniors.\n\nBut now there are more and more situations where staffing has been reduced. Staffing has been reduced from RNs to LPNs to PCAs. In a situation where you used to have an RN on the floor at all times 24-7, you now have an RN on call that's not even in the building, that will come in. Or you have LPNs that'll come in to do specific services, not be there all the time. There's been quite a bit of downloading that I've seen over the last few years. It's really sort of a frightening trend more than being something that is an imminent danger. In most places, the residents are still cared for in the best way they can. The seniors are still given the attention they need. There are always some places and some situations that are not as good as others, but basically people are getting good care.\n\n",

      "article": "On June 14, 1977 the new organization which they named United Nurses of Alberta moved into its own offices. Gurty Chinell was the union's first President and Bob Donahue became the first executive director of the new union. Two months after founding UNA, the nurses were deadlocked in contract negotiations with the Alberta Hospitals Association and when conciliation efforts failed, they ended up voting for their first strike. About twenty-five hundred nurses at seven hospitals began a legal strike on July 4th, 1977. Four days later, the provincial Cabinet passed an Order-in-Council ordering the nurses back to work and establishing a tribunal to work out a settlement binding on both parties. The nurses went back to work they had only collected two months of union dues since the UNA had been established. They could not pay the heavy fines threatened by the government. Mr. Justice Bowen, the arbitrator, awarded the nurses a nine per cent salary adjustment over one year, and the government had to do some fancy footwork to pay this in light of the six per cent ceiling in place with federal Wage and Price controls but the necessary legislation was passed and the nurses received their money.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Justice Bowen rejected the union standard Rand formula for the nurses. The nationally accepted Rand formula makes it necessary for all employees in a bargaining unit to pay dues, pay the expenses of the union that represents and works for them, whether they choose to become members or not. Under Rand, it is normal for the employer to deduct union dues from pay cheques and remit the money to the union. The following year, however, UNA successfully negotiated the first hospital collective agreement (without strike action) and won the inclusion of the the Rand formula.\n\n",

This position was overwhelmingly endorsed by 84 of the 86 Staff Nurse Associations at their first general meeting on February 23, 1977.  But the Alberta Association of Registered Nurses (AARN) Provincial Council blocked changes to the way membership dues were shared with the PSNC.\n\nThe only way the PSNC could effect the changes it desired was to use the decision-making mechanisms of a general AARN meeting. The staff nurses could easily win a majority vote.  But the Provincial Council for some time refused to call a general meeting.\n\nFinally, on May 6, 1977, the AARN called a general meeting to be held immediately after the Annual Meeting.  1300 nurses attended this meeting in Calgary and represented the widespread concerns of nurses on the recent events and the proposed splitting up of the two divisions of the AARN.  The meeting was filled with tension and confrontation, and finally Gurty Chinell announced the decision of the PSNC to form an independent organization, and requested the support of the AARN so as to protect existing Collective Agreements. Adjournment was abruptly moved and seconded, and the United Nurses of Alberta was born.\n\n",

      "article": "Maureen Brass loved excitement and adventure, making her a perfect candidate for nursing in the north.  Maureen and a friend were in Calgary in 1969, checking out the Stampede – when the two district nurses decided to take an airbus to Edmonton and look up a woman they had heard about.\n\n“(We) got another taxi to, I think its Chancellor Square in Edmonton, knocked on the door of this lady who recruited nurses for the Arctic.  She said years later, “I’ll never forget you, you’re the first two people that ever knocked on my door and asked for jobs in the Arctic.”” – Maureen Brass in interview.\n\nMaureen Brass spent one year in the Arctic, before returning to Edmonton, and then spending three years on the Stony Indian First Nation.\n\nBut Brass will never forget her time in the far north, and her first posting at Cape Dorset.\n\n“I got a letter from the supervisor in October, and I’d only gone there in July.  It said, would I be willing to go to Clyde River?  They’d had a nurse there for a few weeks, but she was going on vacation and they didn’t know if she was coming back, and would I consider going?”\n\nMaureen pulled out a map to find the location of Clyde River –it would be an adventure north of 70!\n\n“I arrived there in the dark.  I had never driven a skidoo, and the first time I attempted it, I went too fast and hit a snow bank and tipped the whole thing.”\n\nThings got a whole lot more exciting when Maureen was asked to travel to a camp, where people were starving.  The people were not able to hunt, because the ice wouldn’t stay frozen on the bay – so they needed a rescue party to bring food.  And, the people also thought the nurse, Maureen, should come as well.\n\n“I had no idea what to wear, what did I know?  The Hudson Bay manager said, I have a caribou outfit, I’ll give it to you,” remembers Maureen.  “He was a little fat and the crotch was below my knees with suspenders.  Then the top you had to pull over your head and it was very stiff.  This is how they got me all dressed in this outfit.”\n\nEarly the next morning, the crew and Maureen set out.   The camp was 140 miles away.  The crew continued towards it until lunch, when they stopped for a break and something to eat.  Maureen was the only female there, and after some grumbling one of the men addressed her.\n\n“The fellow that was in charge of me said, “You need to piss, sweetheart?”  I said, what?  I’m looking around, there’s nothing but sea ice.  I said, “No, I most certainly do not!”  I managed to keep going until later on that day when I was pretty desperate and had to go.  But the big story was trying to get out of this caribou outfit.”\n\nMaureen says traveling to the camp was her Everest.  Many of the people she met had impetigo, lice and had never been immunized.  So, Maureen’s taste for adventure, was more than just an experience, she truly filled a need.\n\n“It was a very memorable visit, and the first time a white person had been there.”\n\nMore than twenty years later, Maureen had built a longstanding career as a public health nurse in Canmore.  And, she was the first person to live there as well.  A sense of wonder and dedication to nursing, under extremely trying and demanding circumstances, healthcare in the north was built with the help of people like Maureen.\n\n",

      "title": "SNAA: The story of the nurses’ union at the University of Alberta Hospital",
      "article": "By the 1970s, nurses at nearly every hospital in Alberta had their own Staff Nurses Association.  The associations worked with local management on many issues but wages were negotiated centrally through the professional association, the Alberta Association of Registered Nurses (AARN). In 1977, nurses voted for a change and to make the negotiating function separate from the professional AARN function. Many of the nurse associations banded together and formed United Nurses of Alberta to bargain together but the nurses at the University of Alberta Hospital, one of the largest in the province, chose to be independent and bargain through their own association.\n\nInitially, however, the nurses were informed they could not form a legal bargaining unit under the Public Service Employees Relations Act (PSERA).  It was not until 1979, that the Staff Nurses Association actually became a legal bargaining agent, after the government had made changes to PSERA.\n\nThe Staff Nurses Association negotiated agreements with the University Hospital in 1979, 1982 and in 1984. Issues that they could not resolve through negotiations went to binding arbitration. In the 1986-87 agreement, the nurses won a professional responsibility clause to allow them a voice in safe conditions for patients.\n\nThe Association had contacts with nursing unions outside Alberta; and in 1985, nurses at the University of Alberta Hospital became the first ones in Alberta to join the National Federation of Nurses Unions (later to become the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions).\n\nIn 1986, nurses at the Alberta Cancer Board (including the Cross Cancer Institute, which was closely associated with University Hospital, and the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary) voted to join the Staff Nurses Association rather than UNA.\n\nAfter the Cancer Board nurses joined, the association changed its name to reflect its new members and became the Staff Nurses Associations of Alberta (SNAA).\n\nIn 1986, UNA member nurses at several health units were forced out on a bitter ten-month strike/lock out. Nurses at some of the health units declined to strike, and over time joined SNAA. Nurses at several additional rural health units across the province also joined SNAA over the next few years.\n\nSNAA never undertook strike action in their collective bargaining.  But, SNAA always supported the UNA strike actions and many SNAA nurses would join the picket line and wear UNA’s “We are worth it!” buttons.  Some SNAA nurses even worked overtime to donate money to the UNA strike fund. During the UNA strikes, the SNAA facilities became a kind of safety valve in the strike process, and the most ill patients were transferred to SNAA hospitals.\n\nIn 1988, United Nurses of Alberta went on the historic 19-day illegal strike. The University Hospital was quickly inundated with transferred patients and was under tremendous pressure. According to SNAA President Barb LeBlanc it resembled, “one huge intensive care unit.”\n\nAt the same time SNAA was also in contract talks, which were at an impasse with no new agreement in sight. The SNAA nurses again showed strong solidarity for their striking UNA colleagues. They joined in on UNA picket lines, and some said the nurses were acting on behalf of all the nurses in the province.\n\nOn February 2nd, while UNA was still on strike, the SNAA had a reporting meeting to decide what to do to bring about a resolution to their bargaining impasse. They decided to ask for a meeting with provincial Premier Don Getty and, at the same time, to donate $25,000 to UNA. At first, Don Getty’s office declined a meeting.  But SNAA Executive Director, Louise Rogers, asked the Premier’s office, “Do you want me to tell hundreds of nurses who are not on strike that the Premier refuses to speak with them?”\n\nThe nurses met twice with Premier Getty and the Labour Minister, and the government offered SNAA a settlement. On February 9th, the members voted to accept it. It was not until February 12th that UNA members voted to accept an offer and ended their strike.\n\nThe SNAA had an illustrious history, but by the late 1990s it became clear that the health employers could use the existence of the two separate nurses’ unions to their advantage in collective bargaining.  The crunch came in 1997 when it appeared that the government and Labour Relations Board were poised to create a “turf war” between the two organizations. Capital Health applied for a single certificate for all RNs at the Royal Alexandra, University of Alberta and Glenrose Hospitals, a move that would have forced nurses to choose between the two organizations in a vote.\n\nThere had been initiatives to explore combining UNA and SNAA before, but in 1997 the leaders of the two organizations got together, determined to avoid a divisive struggle.  The leaderships agreed on an amalgamation plan which was strongly supported by both a vote of SNAA members and of a special delegate meeting of UNA. On October 15th, the two organizations combined under the UNA name and effectively created one nurses’ union for almost all the Registered Nurses and Registered Psychiatric Nurses in the province.\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "There can be no doubt that nursing is a high-stress, intense profession.  But sometimes, even nurses can find a few moments for a little bit of fun and humour on the job.\n\nSandie Rentz recalls one of her favourite moments to laugh out loud!  Sandy was orienting a new nurse one night, and one of the standard jobs was to clean the patients' dentures.  Every night this task had to be completed; but once a week, an extra good soak was needed.  Sandy left her trainee to the task and when she returned, some thing very funny, if not a little distressing, had happened.\n\n'...I came back and here she had emptied everyone's denture containers into a massive bowl - everyone's was in there together.  I walked in a just sort of froze, and I said, 'What are you doing?' And then she said, 'I'm cleaning the dentures.'  And I said, 'But now whose are - you know, how are we going to know whose are whose?'\n\nSandie says for someone new it was an honest mistake.  But still, it had to be dealt with.  Sandie had to tell the cooks to make soft food for the patients, and a dentist was brought in to hit each patient until the right dentures were matched to each person.  Sandie recalls that cleaning the patient's dentures was all part of the personal care - something she's not sure nurses today have the time to do.\n\nHolly Heffernan says it is getting tougher to find time to let off steam - because nurses are so run off their feet and the patient loads are so high.  However, one of her favourite ways was to have a water fight!\n\n'We would be working hard all night and finally getting rid of the last patient or whatever and we'd be making beds or whatever, cleaning up, and we'd sort of start a water fight... A few of us would get wet and you'd sit down and think, 'Ahh, that was great.  Now, I'm ready to start off on the next one, whoever comes in the door, we are ready for you.''\n\nJane Sustrik remembers taking the fun a little further - especially around the time of someone's birthday.\n\n'There's times, you know, whoever's birthday it was, we'd tape them to a stretcher.  This is - most of the fun happened on nights when patients are sleeping, right?  But you'd tape them to the stretcher and put them in the elevator, those kinds of things.'\n\nJane says the nurses were always professional, and the jokes were in good spirit and harmless.  She remembers when one was put over on her nursing unit.\n\n'I remember, the one aid we had in the burn unit... one day he took the old phones that you could unscrew the receiver parts and he put garlic in there without us knowing, right?  We were always trying to get each other.  And we'd be, like, 'What is that smell around here?'\n\nJane recalls those moments as the outlets that nurses used to deal with the stress and the kinds of illnesses and crisis staff in hospitals are forced to deal with.  She says it was hard for nurses not to take those things home.  To deal with it, sometimes it was good to talk.  But, sometimes, for nurses who can find a few seconds, the best medicine definitely is humour.\n\n",

      "title": "Government makes it illegal for hospital nurses to strike",
      "article": "In 1983, the Alberta government took away the hospital nurses' legal right to strike with Bill 44. The law provided for compulsory arbitration to resolve bargaining issues and it provided for heavy fines and the suspension of union dues for nurses if they dare go on strike. UNA nurses were outraged by the law and pointed out that it violated their basic human rights. Moreover, the forced arbitration almost totally removed any incentive for employers to actually negotiate with nurses. The nurses adopted a defiant policy of refusing arbitration and insisting that only they would determine if and when they would take job action.\n\nBill 44 didn't cover the Health Unit workers and when the 1985 round of negotiations with the Health Unit Association of Alberta (HUAA) and other employers in the Alberta West Central Health Unit included major 'takeaways', ten UNA health units began a legal strike. At the same time the Victorian Order of Nurses in Calgary began a strike for better wages and working conditions, but were foiled in their efforts when the employer unilaterally decided not to provide nursing services to its clients. The nurses were forced to find other employment.\n\nThe negotiations with the Health Units Association got complicated in terms of who was at which bargaining table and some groups arrived at accepted negotiated settlements earlier than others. Eventually, by late 1985 five of the bargaining units were covered and the striking nurses in Alberta West Central celebrated by publishing a cookbook entitled Strike One.\n\nFor the other five units it was January of 1986 before the dust had cleared. The point had been made, though, that takeaways and rollbacks were not acceptable and the nurses did receive a small wage increase. It wasn't until 1990 that this group received a large wage increase that gave them parity with the hospital nurses.\n\nAs a result of the differences in settlement times and the additional complications of some employers offering to top up earlier settlements to the later settlement standards, nurses at three of the Health Units left the UNA.\n\n",

Legal wrangling resulted and the Labour Relations Board the UNA not to proceed with the vote (at three o'clock in the morning), as even the strike question on the ballot would be considered a strike threat and illegal. Nurses were outraged when they were told they could not even hold a vote on a strike. UNA went ahead with the vote at seven a.m. the next morning and nurses voted overwhelmingly and served notice that the illegal strike would begin on January 25th.\n\nThe strike did indeed begin--involving ninety-eight hospitals and fourteen thousand nurses and including the three Crown hospitals which never had had the right to strike, so were now in the same boat as the others.\n\nLegal action began immediately and the Labour Relations Board issued a cease and desist order, and then filed its rulings on 'threatening to strike' and 'causing a strike' with the Courts. This process of filing LRB orders with the Courts, where they were automatically stamped as court orders, opened the way for later charges of contempt of Court. Contempt of court proceedings against both the UNA and individual nurses were begun shortly thereafter.\n\nAs early as January 25, 1988, some employers applied to the LRB for the right to cease the collection of union dues for six months-a request granted by the LRB.\n\nUnions from across Canada began sending telegrams and letters of support, and followed shortly afterward with cheques. Mr. Dave Werlin, president of the Alberta Federation of Labour, supported the striking nurses and promised that 'Alberta workers would not let UNA go under financially'.\n\nOn January 26, 1988, a permanent court injunction against picketing at the three Crown hospitals was granted by the Courts. Over 1,000 nurses responded by picketing those hospitals.\n\nOn January 27, 1988, individual nurses began to be served with civil contempt of Court charges. By the end of the strike over 75 such individual charges would be laid and heard. Nurses were also threatened with graduated discipline, up to and including termination.\n\nThe government charged UNA with criminal contempt of court. The government requested a $1 million fine and sequestration (seizure) of all the union's assets. On February 9, UNA paid the first criminal contempt fine. At the end of the strike, including all the individual fines UNA paid nearly half a million dollars in fines, the largest fines every paid by a union in Canada. Unions and individuals from across the country supported the nurses courageous stand and generous solidarity contributions paid most of the huge fine bills.\n\nUNA appealed the contempt fines all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, but finally the appeal was turned down.\n\nHigh-pressure negotiations also continued even as the judges were leveling fines. A settlement was reached and UNA took it to the striking nurses. On February 12th, UNA members accepted the employers' improved offer and the settlement was reached. The nurses returned to work the next day February 13th, after an 18 day strike. The settlement was termed a 'tread water' deal, the employers rollbacks and takeaways were dropped, but the nurses had not made significant gains. The benefits were reaped in the 1990 round of negotiations when employers showed a much greated respect for nurses and the negotiation process.\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "Of course, there are many different places that you'll find nurses. Chris Tigeris and Barb Heath both worked at Great Western Garments, the factory that made blue jeans, beginning in the 1980s. It was called the Levi Straus GWG factory when they started there. Their job title was 'occupational health nurse.'\n\nBarb Heath: An occupational health nurse looks after the health, safety, and tries helping with the wellness of employees. So I would be there as the nurse who would help them if they got hurt, but also proactively try and education them so they didn't get hurt in the first place. In the safety area, working with teaching them and helping them do accident investigations, teaching them about the importance of doing inspections and looking for hazards and things that could cause injuries before the injuries actually happen. I did a lot of education with the safety stuff. But also with wellness, I did different sorts of wellness training. Sometimes did training programs during the noon hour, which we call Lunch & Learn. Taught the employees about breast cancer and what they could do preventatively - going for mammography, things like that.I worked three days a week, the last half of the week. People would be coming to me throughout the day. Sometimes coffee breaks were so busy they decided to come between coffee break and lunch. I'd help them with whatever problems they presented, charting on what the problem was. If there was any kind of health and safety presentation that I was making, I'd be working on that. Every day was different. Every day there was a new problem. Occasionally there was a group of people that wanted to come see me because they had a big safety concern. Then I would try and sort through that and figure out what we could do.\n\nChris Tigeris: I found job sharing worked really good for me and my family situation. The types of things that Barb did on her days working were the same kind of things I did. We literally took the job and cut it in half and tried to share it as much as possible. We'd monitor the absenteeism and make sure employees who were off on sick leave got their papers in, got paid when they were on sick leave. If employees were off on WCB, we made sure we got the forms in and monitored that they were getting paid, and did all the disability management.\n\nPiece work was often a cause of injuries, as people were working quickly and perhaps not too carefully to increase their output and hence their pay.   Barb Heath explains that there were many elbow injuries.\n\nElbow injuries, wrist injuries, carpal tunnel, shoulder injuries. Those were the main injuries that we saw. And like I said earlier, they quite often left them so long that they would be having numbness all the way up their arm. Or they couldn't even throw their jeans over to their bundle because their arm hurt so bad. So it was really important that we tried to get to them right away. If they could take a bit of time off, for the first few days it helped.\n\nBarb Heath: We had physiotherapists come in during the last five years that we were working. They did some preventative exercises that we could teach our workers. When they were first hired, we'd go through some things that they would have to do before work, and tell them to take some mini stretch breaks during the day. We'd show them the exercises that they had to do throughout the day, and we'd make them show them back to us. Then we'd check them after they were there for so long. We saw quite often, people that were new hires were the ones that were at risk for getting an injury. So we would follow up and have them come back to us and tell us how they were doing. Because quite often they did have sore limbs, and they were too afraid to come and tell us.\n\n\n\nThe nurses used their imagination and their willingness to keep up with the changes to help prevent injuries.\n\nChris Tigeris: Another thing we did was ergonomics. When we were setting up machines, we tried to make sure it was the right fit for the worker. We had an ergonomics committee, and we involved people that had been at the plant for years and knew lots of jobs, and had really good suggestions. We had one lady, Bonnie, who knew every job inside out. She was really helpful for the ergonomics team, because she knew how the job should flow.\n\nBarb Heath: One of the things that was really neat that we thought of was to put up pictures when we were advertising for a new job. Put up pictures of a person, and then shade in the area that might get sore if they were working on that job. So they could just see, even if they couldn't read, just by looking at the picture. If the left shoulder was shaded in the picture, then they knew they'd better have strong left shoulder muscles.\n\n\n\nMany changes occurred over the years.\n\nChris Tigeris: Back in 1986 when I started, eye glasses were one of the first things everyone had to wear. But it wasn't mandatory on all machines, because some machines had a little piece of plastic in front of the needle that was supposed to stop the needle from hitting the person's face if it broke off. But that ended up being changed so that everyone wore glasses.\n\n'The mesh gloves you mentioned were before that, and I don't know when those really started. But it's basically a chain link glove that's just worn on the opposite hand of the cutting hand. If they were right handed and pushed the cutting machine with their right hand, they wore it on the left hand. If they were moving fabric around and they accidentally hit the blade, the blade would break a link. But they'd move their hand out of the way so they wouldn't get cut.\n\n\n\nBecause of the number of women in the plant, the focus was often on women's health issues.\n\nChris Tigeris: There was a lot of focus on women's things, but that's only because that was the majority of the people there. When we did breast self-examination with a mammography that came on site, it's the only company in Alberta that's ever had mammography come on site and do the actual xrays on site. It's only because we had the ideal population here. We had all these women. A lot of them were of the age that they should be having mammographies, and they wouldn't be going voluntarily on their own the first time.\n\n\n\nMany changes over the years, many friendships made from all nationalities in a factory situation.\n\nBarb Heath: I remember every summer we had a picnic, a barbeque. They made a big deal of it. Usually it was like a dress-up kind of thing. We'd have some sort of theme - Klondike Days dress or Hawaiian dress or something like that. That was some of the socialization stuff that we did. I remember one time a group of us getting dressed up as The Village People. The ladies were so excited coming off the floor, because we were all singing. It was just a really happy atmosphere. A lot of neat people to work with, and they all got excited with us.\n\nThank you to Catherine Cole for permission to use her interview with Barb Heath and Chris Tigeris.\n\n",

Hardisty was able to keep the home operating by the use of management nurses and others imported from elsewhere, and the striking nurses eventually found other jobs.\n\nThe same year bargaining began again for the new provincial collective agreement and by January 1st of 1982, the UNA was in a strike position again. The nurses wanted dramatic further salary increases as well as to make overtime voluntary, safety measures and 229 other improvements. The government threw a monkey wrench into the proceedings by imposing a Disputes Inquiry Board to hold hearings into the unresolved issues, prohibiting strike action until the report was completed. Penalties for failing to comply included huge fines.\n\nUNA complied with the Disputes Inquiry Board process, but ran into difficulty when the Minister of Labour ordered a government-supervised vote for UNA members to accept or reject the Board recommendations.  The Minister ordered this government-supervised vote to take place on February 11.  UNA had already ordered a UNA vote, compliant with the UNA Constitution, to be held February 12.  UNA directed its members to boycott the government-supervised vote of February 11, and the government threatened to impose the results of the February 11th vote even if only one nurse voted.  The government backed down temporarily and did not impose the results of the few voters in the February 11 vote.  On February 12, UNA members rejected the recommendations.  The law was later changed so that a union's refusal to vote in a government-supervised vote was declared illegal, and the government was given the power to impose their vote results as a settlement of the dispute.\n\nOn February 16, 1982, UNA began a legal strike at sixty-nine (69) Alberta Hospitals affecting 6,000  nurses.  UNA represented 8,300 hospital nurses at the bargaining table, but with the implementation of the LRB ruling that some Locals could not reconsider and vote to strike, only 6,000 were actually in a legal position to strike.\n\nThe strike dragged on and on. Then, on March 10th, the government passed Bill 11 ordering nurses back to work and establishing another tribunal under Mr. Justice Forsyth. The law included huge penalties, including decertification of the union, and the nurses returned to work on March 11 as ordered.\n\nMr. Justice Forsyth held 17 days of hearings and brought down his binding award in July of that year that mandated a twenty-nine per cent wage increase over two years, improved scheduling, mandatory overtime, and, what must have been a relief to many nurses, a no-working-alone provision.  \n\nIn 1982, there was also a dispute for the nurses working in Health Units, and their employers locked out more than 300 UNA nurses. The lockout affected nurses in locations widely spread around the province, from Leduc to Lethbridge.   The lockout lasted a month and was finally resolved with a negotiated agreement for a 14 per cent wage increase and compensation for lost benefits.\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "Nurses demand concerns about care and safety be taken seriously\n\nNurses face a unique dilemma.\n\nOn the one hand they have a professional and ethical responsibility to protect the interest of patients. On the other hand, they are expected to obey directives from employers, even where such directives may compromise patient safety.\n\nThe only RN on night shift in a small hospital may become overwhelmed by new admissions, or critically ill patients who suddenly become unstable and need her full attention. She knows she needs another RN to provide safe care to her patients. She phones her supervisor to ask permission to call in a colleague to help. Her supervisor says, 'No, we're over budget, you will just have to cope.'\n\nIf she obeys her supervisor, thereby failing to maintain professional standards, she risks discipline from her professional association as well as legal liability for any harm arising to the patient. If she disobeys her supervisor, and calls a colleague in to assist, she may be disciplined by her employer, including suspension or dismissal.\n\nNurses who joined unions were seeking much more than protection against unjust dismissal, unworkable schedules, or inadequate salaries or benefits. Nurses also expect their unions to help solve this dilemma- responsibility without authority.\n\n\n\nIn Alberta 'professional responsibility' was a major issue in contract negotiations\n\nThe right to exercise some control over the safe care of patients has, since the time of Florence Nightingale, been a central concern of nurses. Nurses have always acted as advocates for their patients, striving to get them the care and resources they need to be well. This theme in the profession carried directly over into their collective bargaining when nurses unionized.\n\nHeather Smith:   'That's were I actually began, started to become active in the union, was through professional responsibility. I didn't see myself as a union activist. A patient advocate, yes. You were always very clear on that, but that's how I came in was through wanting to advocate, wanting to get the staffing for the patients on my medical unit.'\n\nIn Alberta,   the right to 'professional responsibility' was one of the major issues behind one of the few provincial strikes by United Nurses of Alberta nurses.   And it was one of the issues, right from the beginning for UNA. As President Heather Smith points out,   'The key issue, the primary issue in initial bargaining was wages. They were atrociously poor. The other issue that came up was the ability to advocate, to have a say and we called that professional responsibility, the professional responsibility committee.'\n\nHelen Krizan: The professional responsibility clause, is one of the only clauses in our contract that lets us have access to the hospital board. In a hospital it's really important to nursing. Maybe we're short staffed, maybe there's something in the institution that's not safe. You keep working, but you can file a form that says this is what happened, this is what we think should change. So it's asking for action on things that you are concerned about.\n\nMike Mearns: The Professional Responsibility Committee was very high on the agenda, because nurses believed that they knew what was good nursing, and they wanted to use their collective bargaining capital to ensure they had a say on how the patients were nursed.\n\nIn negotiations in 1980 both the wages and the professional responsibility came to a head.\n\nTrudy Richardson who worked as UNA's education officer for many years remembers it clearly. 'So bad were the wages that UNA's ingoing proposal was for a wage increase of 33.3% and the employer offered at 29% wage increase, but they refused a professional responsibility committee.   They said the question of professional responsibility didn't lie with the nurses that was management's responsibility and nurses should just do what they were told and not question the professional judgment of the employer regarding nursing.'   \n\nThe stand off led to a strike. The nurses were quickly ordered back to work, but despite the fact they had been offered a nearly 30% wage increase, the nurses refused to drop their demands for professional authority.\n\nFinally the courts were about to become involved and at the last minute negotiations continued.   Trudy Richardson remembers: 'They just bargained right through that weekend, hour after hour after hour.   There were two huge impediments: one was the question of wages and at some point early in that marathon the employer agreed to I think it was 39.8% which was 10% higher than their last offer and more than the nurses had initially asked for.   So obviously they knew these nurses were serious and it also indicated how badly paid they had been. A 40% wage increase like that doesn't happen often.   But what held up the talks, the second huge thing was a professional responsibility committee.   They were more insulted by the nurses' demand for a say in the quality of health care that was being delivered than they were about whatever the money was and it was only into the very, very early morning of the Sunday night Monday morning that they finally agreed to the professional responsibility committee.'\n\nMargaret Brick : The union has been the only way I've been able to see where I can fight for my patients.\n\nThe nurses had successfully negotiated a mechanism to raise their professional concerns about their patients' care and safety. The new contract laid out the process for the professional responsibility committee or PRC. Nurses always have the right to bring up concerns to the joint nurse-employer committee and have it addressed. If the nurses are not satisfied with solutions that are reached, they can take their concerns directly to the governing board of the Health Region or employer. Over the years nurses have filed hundreds and hundreds of PRC complaints and made many, many presentations to the Boards of Directors.\n\nLee McNiven: We can do it successfully through our collective agreement, through our professional responsibility committee, right within our worksite, within our nursing unit where we work. The care can be upgraded and other issues related to patient care can be talked about. Those things that we don't think we have any impact onto, ie. that there is no linen cart that's going to arrive on the nursing unit and midnight, and you're out of linen. What do you do about that?\n\n\n\nNurses use their contract rights to protect patients\n\nInadequate nurse staffing is the safety concern that nurses raise far more frequently than any other.   At Alberta Hospital Edmonton, for example, nurses took the following complaint right through the Capital Health Board of Directors\n\n\n\nNurses, when unavailable due to vacation, illness or other reasons, are being replaced by psychiatric aides, or in some cases, not being replaced at all, resulting in inadequate nursing care.   This is an ongoing problem.   It is happening for both predictable absences such as vacation leave, and for unpredictable absences, such as illness.   Levels of permanent nursing staff are insufficient to provide accessible, sustainable, and consistent quality nursing care.\n\nCynthia Perkins: And, in fact, in our emergency department over the last six years, we have had so many professional responsibility concerns there that they have increased the staffing by probably eight FTEs because the manager there was very receptive, and he used these PRCs as ammunition to his manager to increase the staffing.   So it really worked in some cases, and so I really encourage people to do that.   It's the only way that we're ever going to get safe staffing levels.\n\nJudith Russell: The first PRC submitted at the Charles Camsell caused a hurricane at level five. I wrote a PRC citing a Dopamine drip on a medical unit, down the hall, unmonitored, as unsafe. Management classified this as high treason. Waiting for the axe to fall, we stood our ground and came out with all our heads intact and the patient included in the winnings.\n\nAfter the tremendous cuts in staffing during the 1990s, nurses also began raising concerns about excessive overtime and being forced to work while they were too tired. Again, this came through the 'professional responsibility' process in many cases.\n\n",

In the next round of negotiations, in 1980, the nurses felt compelled to take strike action--this time involving sixty-four hundred nurses at 79 hospitals. Wage demands were at the heart of the problem-the nurses were looking for a 33.3 per cent salary increase. Nursing salaries had long been lagging behind and nurses at the time were making less than grocery check out clerks. Also at issue in the talks were scheduling provisions, the ability of nurses to take their accumulated benefits with them when they moved to another hospital and the nurses right to some professional authority, 'the professional responsibility committee' provision.\n\nThe strike began on April 18th and by April 21st the Order-in-Council had been passed ordering them back to work - the same fines were threatened and the same compulsory arbitration imposed. But this time the nurses refused to return meekly to work. They stayed out on strike and launched court action to challenge the order.   The court arguments were well under way when, on April 27th, a negotiated settlement was reached and the nurses ended their strike. The settlement included a 39.8 per cent wage increase over two years, the scheduling improvements, the Professional Responsibility Committee and over 50 other improvements.\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "Nurses elected Heather Smith as provincial UNA President after the major hospital nurses' strike in 1988. Heather had played a major role in the historic dispute as a member of the negotiating committee and as a public spokesperson. Heather had been President of her UNA Local #79 at the Edmonton General Hospital. It was concern about her patients that Heather says got her involved in her union.\n\nBorn and raised in Ontario, Heather Smith graduated from Algonquin College in 1976 and came to Alberta to work as a nurse. Starting out in nursing is a challenging experience that most nurses have in common. Heather recalls: 'It's terrifying. You have no idea the kind of terror you have, the first time you are in charge. The first time you're the only person on the unit, which was common at that time, on a night shift and there's 44 people out there, some of them are incredibly ill.' \n\nShe says she'd always wanted to be a nurse. 'I never looked into what I was going to be paid as a nurse. I never really considered what the hours of work were going to be or that I'd be working eight days stretches The Edmonton General was a fairly good employer and getting one in three weekends off was actually a real luxury. But I didn't think about any of those things.'\n\nJust months after starting her career, Heather was out on the picket line in the first UNA strike.\n\n'Senior nurses on my unit said, come on, Heather, we're going on strike and there was a very respectful relationship… well I didn't know what the issues were or what was really happening but I said okay. Mrs. Schwindt and Mrs. Barr say this is what we're going to do, then this is what we're going to do.'\n\nShe says the three strikes, in 1977, 1980 and 1982 were a huge education 'within our union in terms of getting nurses to believe in their own value. I recall we got this wage proposal, and some of it sounded really ridiculous, you know, we were asking for 40% increases. But we were paid less then the Safeway packing people. We started to question the value of our contribution to health care.'\n\nWithin a few years UNA had succeeded in negotiating responsibility committees, a mechanism for nurses to raise issues of patient safety and professional concerns.\n\n'Some people came to me on my unit and said: You tend to be fairly mouthy about patient care issues. It was really, really hard work in the medical unit I was on. So [they said] we just got this committee and you should come and be on it. And that's how I started and became active in the union around professional responsibility.'\n\nWithin a couple of years Heather Smith was President of her UNA Local and in 1985 she was elected to the provincial hospital nurses' negotiating committee.  In 1988, she was again elected to the committee.  In 1983, the Alberta government had made it illegal for hospital nurses to strike.\n\nNurses didn't really see themselves as being on strike for themselves, Heather says. They were on strike to achieve improvements for their patients, like the Professional Responsibility Committee.\n\n'It doesn't matter what law you pass, we'll do whatever we have to do, because that's what nurses did. It was equivalent to hoarding laundry. You knew that on the weekends there was going to be a shortage of laundry because they never, ever provided enough face clothes and laundry. So, Friday, you squirreled it away. You did what you had to do to make sure you had the laundry for your patients on the weekend.'\n\nIn 1988 there was a nursing shortage in the province, but the employers came to the table demanding contract rollbacks.  'That's the kind of arrogance they had, the disregard, the lack of respect they had for us. So from the start it was clear: there was going to be a confrontation.' Heather says.  UNA nurses defied the law prohibiting them from striking, paid fines that were the highest ever in Canada. Finally they reached a negotiated settlement.\n\nIn the 1990s, nurses faced further problems: huge health care funding cuts from the federal and provincial governments, hospital closures and the layoff of thousands of Registered nurses. The huge cuts galvanized nurses to defending the public health care system.\n\nHeather Smith had earlier joined the Friends of Medicare coalition. With the cuts nurses became more vocal about broader health care system issues.\n\n'When we are criticizing government's actions we are fairly clear in tying that back to the impact on patients,' Heather Smith says.  She became a widely recognized leader on the issue of public health care and the nurses became strong partners in the campaigns opposing the provincial Bill 37 and Bill 11 laws and the government's health care privatization agenda.\n\nAt the same time, more and more nurses came into the UNA fold. In 1997, the Staff Nurses Association of Alberta and UNA amalgamated. Other nurses also joined the provincial union, including nurses in community health care and in private nursing home facilities. By 2005, nearly 23,000 of the approximately 27,000 Registered Nurses and Registered Psychiatric Nurses in Alberta were members of UNA.\n\nHeather Smith also continued on the provincial contract negotiating committee and has participated in seven rounds of collective bargaining. She is widely respected as a skilled negotiator and nurses in Alberta enjoy one of the best collective agreements in the country.\n\n\n\n",

Vacations improved, as did long term disability payments and language was added to the contract that prevented the employers from making contractual arrangements with others that would contravene the collective agreement. For the health unit nurses there was at last parity with the hospital nurses.\n\nBethany Care Home in Cochrane had a long and bitter struggle the following year to get their first contract, but returning to work after five months, they still had not received the same provisions as other hospital workers.\n\n",

      "article": "Since the time of Florence Nightingale, Registered nurses have been advocates for better care for their patients.   This advocacy runs across the health care spectrum, from pushing for adequate laundry, sheets and towels on weekends,   right through to what public health care policy creates the best health outcomes. Around the world nurses have been active proponents of policy that provides the best care for the broadest range of people.\n\nIn Canada and Alberta, nurses as a profession have been strong supporters of the universal, public health system that is accessible to all people, Canadian medicare.\n\nAs UNA Vice President Bev Dick says,\n\n\n\n'Nurses are very concerned these days, particularly in Alberta, with this government, with the privatization initiatives that are going on and what that is going to mean for patient care in this province... It's the quality of care and maintaining a strong public healthcare system that's important to nurses.'\n\n\n\nIn October of 1993, nurses helped organize a very successful health care rally opposing the government's extensive cuts to health care budgets and to health care staffing. UNA worked with the Alberta Association of Registered Nurses and the Staff Nurses Association of Alberta in calling a media conference to denounce the government's cutbacks to health care. These three nursing organizations also funded and developed a successful newspaper advertising campaign.\n\n  UNA President Heather Smith said her support from public health care began early,\n\n\n\n'It became very clear to me that we had something that allowed us to practice nursing in a different kind of way.   In a better kind of way; that we weren't worried about how much the swab cost and we weren't worried about entering it into our chart... You got the sense of the nursing practice in the United States and I knew that what we had here was different because that wasn't the focus of our care.'\n\n\n\nIn 1996, Albertans were faced with another year of government debt reduction at the expense of health care, education and social services.\n\nIn February, the Salvation Army Grace Hospital in Calgary closed. 1996 also saw the closures of the Charles Camsell Hospital in Edmonton, the Holy Cross Hospital in Calgary and the Minburn-Vermilion Health Unit.\n\nAt the same time the government announced that they were putting $11.4 million dollars into Regional Health Authority budgets to alleviate the long waiting lists for joint replacement and for cardiac surgery.\n\nUNA produced an Alberta Health Care Fact Sheet showing that prior to any cuts being made in health care, Alberta spent less of its total wealth on health care than any other Canadian province. Before 1994, Alberta spent only 5.99% of its wealth on health care, compared to the national average of 6.97%. After 1994, Alberta's health care expenditure percentage was reduced dramatically.\n\nNurse Pam Little, has noticed many changes, since the 1990s.\n\n\n\n'We charge for many things [now]. We used to put casts on without charging and now we charge. There's all sorts of appliances that we charge for. I know where I work we keep a stash. We tell patients, if you want to bring this back after you're finished with it, that's great. The company would shudder at that, but we need them because we have people who need a splint and can't afford the $50 or $100 or whatever it costs... I find it really disturbing the things that I see happening, that I actually took for granted and can't believe that now people are having to make choices.'\n\n\n\nThe total number of permanently-employed registered nurses in Alberta plummeted by 30 percent over 1995. Thousands of nurses were laid off. When UNA publicly released this information, the government ceased collecting the data and statistics for 1996 were not available.\n\nAt the 1997 UNA Annual General Meeting the number one concern of the delegates was the privatization of health care. In a UNA survey, 94 percent of nurses rated the increasing privatization of health care as 'a very important issue for UNA action'. UNA sponsored a national postcard campaign calling for a Royal Commission on health care. Thousands of postcards were distributed by UNA members and supporters and received by the federal Minister of Health.\n\nUNA organizationally and members as individuals continued to be active in coalitions and citizen efforts to protect the public health system.   Nurses were active opponents when the government introduced Bill 37 to allow for-profit hospitals in the late 1990s. The Alberta government withdrew the legisation.   In 2000, nurses were again involved with the Friends of Medicare sponsored coalition that mounted a high profile campaign against Bill 11, the Health Care Protection Act.   The Legislation was eventually passed, but in a much watered-down state that again precluded full-tilt private hospitals from opening.\n\nUNA President Heather Smith noted the real agenda,\n\n'The intent of Bill 37 was to authorize the operation of private for profit hospitals.   It evolved into Bill 11 the Health Care Protection Act which is oxymoronic because it has nothing to do with protecting Health Care.'\n\n\n\n",

The government wanted widespread changes with 'regionalization'. Which unions would represent merged staffs? Which collective agreement would apply? How would seniority work? Things really kicked into gear in 1993 when the new Premier, Ralph Klein, announced a retroactive funding cut for health care--the overall intention was to cut $1 billion dollars from health care funding over the next four years.\n\nEmployers acted differently in regard to the cutbacks. Some immediately started laying off nurses, others replaced nursing positions with less qualified (and therefore cheaper) classifications. One of the worksites apparently told nurses to put Patient Hostess on their name tag, rather than RN.   Attempts were made to sort this all out before the next round of negotiations by getting the government, health care employers and the health care unions to sit down and discuss the implications of the rollbacks and to come up with some solutions.\n\nUltimately, however, the huge cuts in budgets had grave consequences. Thousands of nurses were laid off.   Most of them left the province, many to the United States. A whole generation of nurses was lost to the Alberta health system. Other health employees numbers were also drastically reduced.\n\nUNA worked closely with the AARN and the Staff Nurses Association to come up with a united front on the proposed changes to the health care system. A health care rally in October of 1993 was organized in conjunction with the Alberta Federation of Labour and the United for Social Justice groups, helping to present a united front to the media.\n\n",

At the most fundamental level, the description of who nurses has changed in Saskatchewan. A century ago, when Saskatchewan became a province, the Grey Nuns were a large nursing presence. Now, however, nursing has become secularized so that any person, man or woman, can become a nurse. Even with the teachings of Florence Nightingale, Saskatchewan's early nurses were largely women of faith.\n\nNursing education has also evolved. In the days of the early twentieth century until the late 1960s, nursing training happened in individual hospitals where nurse trainees provided work in return for their training. With the introduction of the Centralized Teaching Program in 1953, the emphasis began to shift from in-hospital training to classroom learning. Currently, most nurses' schooling is carried out in a classroom. Although there is still more to learn during a students' practicum in the hospital.\n\nOver time, nurses uniforms have transformed from white, starched uniforms with caps to the more comfortable cotton shirt and pant combination (or ‘scrubs’) that we see in hospitals today. There are mixed feelings about the uniform's transformation. While ‘scrubs’ are certainly more comfortable, some agree that a more formal uniform gives nurses an air of professionalism to which current uniforms cannot subscribe.\n\nWith all of the changes that nursing has undergone in the last century, the fundamentals of nursing remain the same. New technologies and increasing specialization may change the way that nurses practice, but the commitment to the patient remains unchanged. For all of the changes that will come in the future, commitment to patient care is one aspect that nursing cannot afford to change.",

The building, its façade almost completely unchanged from its original (1914) form, once housed over one thousand psychiatric patients. The facility was largely self-contained, as patients tended a farm and vegetable patches as part of their therapy.\n\nMuch has changed since the building became a 178-bed general hospital. There is no longer a farm, but a large vegetable patch and wood workshop still provide therapy for some of the patients. Psychiatric nurses have played a large role in the history of Saskatchewan Hospital. They were some of the first staff and remain an integral part of hospital workings. Annie Sheldon was one of the first of these. She began working on staff in 1915 as a way to make ends meet while her husband was away at war. Sheldon's strong constitution and commitment to her patients was exemplified when the Spanish Flu of 1918-1919 killed 115 residents of the hospital and whittled the staff down to two members: Sheldon and the physician (Dr. MacNeill). ‘They wore masks and sprayed themselves with disinfectant. Luckily, they were able to protect themselves. They both existed on catnaps, not daring to leave the hospital in case their families were to become infected...These were the kinds of people that made up the first staff at the Saskatchewan Hospital--honest, hard-working, conscientious, loyal, trustworthy, courageous and God-fearing’ (Kildaw, 28-29).",

      "article": "The first great war of the twentieth century, World War I, marked the end of an age of innocence. It was the first war that saw almost global participation. It was the first time that casualties of that magnitude had ever been seen. It was the first time that civilians were the target of enemy fire. Gladys Matheson, a Saskatchewan nurse, spent time overseas during WWI. While not much remains in terms of written history, there are a few photographs that create a picture of life as a nurse during the Great War.\n\nBeing so close to the battlefront meant that nurses would tend to soldiers who had been wounded in battle. Rows upon rows of wounded soldiers would be laid out on stretchers on the cold, hard ground where the nurses would have to stoop or even get onto their knees to provide care. This was a far cry from the warm hospitals back home with proper equipment and enough medical personnel to take care of all patients. No matter how rough the conditions, nurses still had to tend to their patients.\n\nThe threat on the front lines was very real, even for those not engaged in battle. Like the soldiers, nurses had to be prepared for gunfire and air-raid attacks. In her collection, Matheson has photographs of nurses posing, wearing helmets, outside of a sandbag shelter during an air-raid practice drill. Such photographs tell a story of bravery on the part of soldiers and non-soldiers alike; those who were putting themselves in harm's way to serve their country.",

      "article": "The Impact of Spanish Influenza\n\nNo one could have imagined, when the flu first started spreading around Europe in May 1918, that it would eventually kill between 50 and 100 million people worldwide.  By October 1, 1918, it had crossed the ocean, along with the many Canadian soldiers returning from battle, and had become solidly entrenched in Saskatchewan.  Within the first three months, 3,906 people had succumbed to influenza – more than the number of Saskatchewan casualties in France during the war. \n\nNow, soldiers were replaced by nurses on the frontlines.  One of those was Annie Sheldon, who worked as a psychiatric nurse at the Saskatchewan Hospital in North Battleford.  Sheldon started with the hospital in 1915, as a means to support herself while her husband was away at war.  It was Sheldon’s strong constitution and commitment to her patients that was exemplified when the flu killed 115 residents of the hospital and decimated the staff, leaving just Sheldon and one physician – Dr. MacNeill.\n\n“Luckily, we were able to protect ourselves.  We wore masks and sprayed ourselves with disinfectant.  We both existed on catnaps, not daring to leave the hospital in case our families were to become infected.” \n\nIn many other communities across the province, the situation was similarly disturbing and bleak. \n\n“The general store at Paradise Hill sat empty except for the dead bodies of the store-keeper and his wife.  Inside a nearby tent there were three more victims.  The eerie silence was only broken by the sounds of a young boy digging graves for his dead mother, father, brother and sister.  Sadly, scenes like these were not uncommon in Saskatchewan at the end of the Great War.” \n\nFrom Maureen Lux, “The Bitter Flats”:  The 1918 Influenza Epidemic in Saskatchewan.\n\nIn rural Saskatchewan, people were simply unarmed for the battle.  Bed rest and nursing care were essential for recovery; however, few people in rural Saskatchewan had access to a hospital.  Schools were closed, entire crews of farm labourers were taken down, and many lost family members, and sometimes even entire families were stricken and died of the flu. \n\nInfluenza stunned the medical community.  By 1918, epidemics, like the plague and smallpox, had been stopped.  Now, a new killer gripped the world – killing approximately 50 thousand people in Canada – more than the casualties in the war.  Influenza attacked all age groups and demographics, but it did seem to prefer the young – those in their 20s to 40s.  It started with sudden weakness, pain and chills.  The victim would then develop a cough, which would turn dark from blood.  Often, what would kill the person would be the onset of pneumonia, and without any antibiotics, the disease was fatal. \n\nHowever, the Spanish Flu epidemic also forced changes to the health care system.  “The provision of free services from municipal doctors that had been introduced in 1916, was formalized by the provincial government in 1919…” (The Impact of the Spanish Influenza Epidemic on Saskatchewan Farm Families, 1918-1919)  Farm women were also given courses on how to tend to the sick, no doubt influencing some women to enter the practice of nursing.",

Her experiences are quite different from modern nursing methods. The use of technology and pharmaceuticals has exploded since her time and has changed the entire medical world, including the way nurses do their jobs. For example, in the 1920s hospitals were cleaned in a very different way than they are today:\n\n’If a patient had had a staph infection or infection of some other nature, when the patient left the ward was sealed. Cotton batting was put all around windows, doors and keyhole. Before sealing the bottom of the door, a Formaldehyde solution had to be put in a large basin and placed in the middle of the ward. All utensils, sheets and blankets, towels, etc., were left in the ward. Then the bottom of the door was sealed and left for forty-eight hours. Lysol and Creolin Carbolic were disinfectants. We had to learn to use our heads, hands and feet and observe as we went along’ (Stearns, 1).\n\nStearns recounts various treatments that were used in her day:\n\n\n\nThere were no Sulpha or Antibiotics or fancy equipment in those days. They were the days of Sinapisms (mustard plasters), Camphorated oil, Murphy (Saline solution) drips, Interstitials, Dakin's solution (a strong disinfectant) for compresses and irrigations, hot turpentine stupes (flannel for fomentations) for abdominal distention from Peritonitis, and soap suds enemas, 1/60 grain Strychnine subcutaneously, Camphor in oil, Luminal and Phenobarbital used mostly as a sleeping pill or to relieve tension, Digitalis, Aloin, Strychnine, Belladonna, and Cascara pills, liquid Cascara, III grain tablets of Cascara, Castor oil, Magnesium Sulphate or Phenolphthalein for bowels, molasses and milk enemas for flatulence. They were tricky to make; if it curdled you had to make another one. There were glass and metal catheters. Some hospitals did not allow nurses to use glass catheters, only doctors could use them, but we were taught how to use them (Stearns, 2).\n\n\n\nStearns' memoirs are fascinating and they give the modern world a glimpse at what it was like to practise nursing in Saskatchewan in the early years.",

      "article": "Weyburn, a small city in southern Saskatchewan, housed one of the largest psychiatric facilities in the province. Opening in 1921, the Weyburn Mental Hospital was massive, eventually housing over one thousand patients. Nursing classes at the facility began in 1931.\n\nDue to its sheer size and progressive therapies, the hospital at Weyburn virtually became its own city. Patients, as part of their therapy, had various jobs around the hospital. Some patients would tend to the animals that were used as food. Others would tend to the produce that was grown. Some would provide grounds-keeping services and others would act as janitorial staff. This kept patients busy and acted as part of their therapy. Patients felt that they were contributing to the place where they lived.\n\nNurses were some of the main caregivers in the facility. Their jobs included working on the wards and providing care similar to that of any hospital. What made nursing in this facility different is that because most patients were in the facility long-term, friendships formed between the staff and patients.\n\nNurses had a chance to get to know the patients in this facility well and taking care of them long-term fostered a relationship that would not have the opportunity to grow in a regular hospital setting.\n\nBecause nurses at the Weyburn psychiatric facility lived in the nursing residences on the facility grounds they often became close friends. As such they spent much of their free time together. Even the nurses that lived in Weyburn rather than on the facility grounds spent much of their free time with those in residence.\n\nIt is often difficult to see mental health facilities in a positive light. However, the Weyburn institution is a case where living in such close quarters with staff and patients fostered a rare sense of community. In the Registered Psychiatric Nurses' Association of Saskatchewan's fifty-year celebration book: Fifty Years in Review , one nurse who worked at the Weyburn facility recounts his memories: ‘Best memories were the camaraderie and the life style at the hospital. The great numbers of staff and patients all under one roof was a unique community. Rarely duplicated in terms of associations with every possible type of personalities, cultures and activities, Great stuff!’",

      "article": "Georgiana Chartier has no regrets about deciding to become a nurse. She vividly remembers her nursing training at St. Paul's Hospital in Saskatoon: it took three years of clinical training, classes and providing services on the wards for her to get through. She lived in residence, as was required of all nurse trainees, and followed the strict rules imposed on students. Classes were held for instruction on theory and other topics that could not be taught on the ward, but class time was minimal compared to the course work of today's nursing graduates. Students would usually put in ten or twelve hours on wards and would attend lectures in addition. Linda Long, a graduate of Yorkton Hospital School of Nursing, remembers working a night shift and then only having a few hours of sleep if she didn't want to miss her noon lecture. Until the introduction of the Centralized Teaching Program, nursing students, like Georgiana and Linda, took all of their training at one hospital.\n\nStudents were accepted to hospital training schools and were immediately put to work on the wards doing tasks such as scrubbing bed pans, washing walls and cleaning linen cupboards. While these tasks were not directly related to nursing, asking questions could get a student into trouble. As their training progressed, students would gradually be given more responsibility for nursing tasks.   Students would perform this work in return for their training. There was no cost to students for training and they received a monthly stipend which basically amounted to spending money.\n\nMost students from this era look back on their training fondly, accepting the menial tasks as simply the first step in working their way up. For others, however, it seemed a militaristic and hierarchical system that needed to be changed.\n\n\n\nOne student recalls her arrival at nursing school. Francis Stearns, a 1926 St. Paul's Hospital graduate, remembers exactly what she was required to do:\n\nI was to report to the Superintendent of Nurses on August 20, bringing with me: three uniforms, six aprons (length six inches from the floor), six bibs, three collars similar to clerical ones, three stiff belts, three pairs of stiff cuffs, six cotton underskirts, three cotton and three flannel night gowns, three pairs of black shoes, one dozen pairs of black stockings, six pairs of bloomers, three cotton and three wool undervests, two pairs of corsets, one kimono, two pairs of bedroom slippers, a watch and twelve hankerchiefs. All these had to be marked with a printed cotton name-tape and sewn in by hand.\n\nI arrived in the afternoon. The Superintendent took me directly to a twenty-bed dormitory where I met my fellow classmates. There were twenty of us. From the time we arrived until the lights out bell rang, we were very busy girls, putting our uniforms etc., away in our cupboards.\n\n",

Mary was a nursing student whose classmate had just called: there was a woman coming to the emergency room already in labour and ready to give birth. Mary was wondering why her classmate had called her- she had not even had her obstetrics training yet! Mary waited in the emergency room for the pregnant woman to arrive and after a long while, realized that she was the victim of a prank played by her fellow classmate. There was no woman about to give birth coming to the emergency room.\n\nBecause of the close quarters in which nursing students lived in hospital schools, very close bonds would develop that would last a lifetime. With these close bonds came many fun times and many pranks, like the one Mary experienced, were played among the students. Many classes have reunions every few years where the grads catch up with old friends and remember the times when they all lived under the same roof. Fond and vivid memories of training days remain even in the minds of nurses who graduated close to half a century ago.\n\nThe social life of nursing students was heavily restricted by the rules of the school. St. Paul's Hospital School of Nursing was an example of this. Not only were early nights the norm, with only one late pass allowed per month, but the schools also distributed a limited amount of spending money for the students to spend on their few days off. There would be dances and performances held by the school for social activities. Despite the restrictions placed on nursing students, many look back on the experience as a positive one, explaining that lifelong friendships were the most important thing gained from nurse training.\n\nMany nurses who graduated from hospital nursing schools believe nursing students today are missing out on the fun times that can only be had when nursing students live together.\n\n",

      "article": "The University of Saskatchewan School of Nursing changed the face of nursing education in Saskatchewan. Progressive for its time, the school placed emphasis on basic science education and academics; a combination which would later become the norm. The school was founded in 1938, a time when new investments were few due to economic slumps. After Canadian nurses had established themselves as exceptional practitioners during World War I and the 1918-1919 influenza epidemic, grateful patients and families had donated funds. More funds also came through 'relief funds raised for the aftermath of the Halifax harbour munitions ship explosion. A major focus of these funds was the establishment of nursing educational programs in teaching and public health at a number of Canadian Universities and the provision of scholarships for qualified nurses'.\n\nLucy Willis, a former University of Saskatchewan School of Nursing Director, wrote a history of the first fifty years of the school. She provides a comprehensive and insightful look at the school's history, even including curriculum changes to show how the school evolved from one of many schools of nursing to the cornerstone institution of nursing education in Saskatchewan. An introduction to the book provides an historical look at the school:\n\n\n\nIn 1938, the University of Saskatchewan established a School of Nursing and began admitting students to an undergraduate program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree. It did so with the encouragement and support of the 21 year old Saskatchewan Registered Nurses' Association whose members had petitioned the University a number of times to provide better basic education. It did so also with the support and advice of Dr. W.S. Lindsay, in charge of medical studies at the University and later the first Dean of the Medical College, who had observed that nurses who had a university education in addition to or as a part of their nursing preparation were superior nurses.\n\nThe initial program was generic, preparing for first level positions in public health agencies and in hospitals in the clinical areas of medical, surgical, obstetrical, pediatric and psychiatric nursing. From the beginning, the program was science based, academically sound and demanding. The graduates soon build up the reputation of being excellent practitioners of nursing care, and many were offered and assumed leadership positions relatively early in their careers. After 1950 special education in teaching, administration, or public health nursing was added to the basic curriculum, and there followed other program for graduate nurses and the R.N. diploma program. Graduates of all the programs have made substantial contributions to health care in Saskatchewan, other provinces, the northern territories, the United States, are known to have service in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. They have staffed hospitals, community health agencies and nursing homes, have worked as occupation health nurses, and as primary care givers in agencies and clinics, have taught in schools and colleges of nursing (Willis: Introduction).\n\n\n\n Through a five-year course at the University of Saskatchewan, nurses would obtain a baccalaureate degree in addition to their nurses' training.\n\n",

      "article": "Kathleen Ellis deserves a special place in the nursing history of Saskatchewan. She is fondly remembered by many as the person to whom we owe the College of Nursing at the University of Saskatchewan (U of S). What many do not remember, but what Lucy Willis (a later College of Nursing Director) reminds us, is that Miss Ellis received funding and go-ahead for the College of Nursing during the Great Depression.\n\n\n\nThe 1930's were the years of the Great Depression which, combined with the long years of drought and crop failures, hit Saskatchewan very hard. The Government cut University funding drastically, and, in spite of excellent management, the U. of S. had to limit programs and cut salaries while still incurring a deficit. There were some months when even payroll could not be met without borrowing money. University officials listened sympathetically to the nurses' petitions during those years but they did not have the resources and so could do little to establish a full undergraduate nursing course. Little, that is, until the Association brought Miss Ellis to the scene.\n\n\n\n Due to limited cash flow across the board, the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses' Association (SRNA) and the university came to an agreement that Miss Ellis would work part time for the SRNA and part time for the university as head of the nursing school. Each institution would pay half her salary. Miss Ellis would work out of an office at the university, but spend half her time as Secretary-Treasurer, Registrar and Advisor to Schools of Nursing for the SRNA.\n\nTo build such a thing from nothing during one of the most difficult economic times the world has seen shows a determination that not many can boast. 'For her part, like other nurse leaders of her time, Miss Ellis had tremendous stamina and was willing to work hard and long for the causes she believed in'.\n\nOne year after the founding of the University School of Nursing, World War II broke out. Miss Ellis was one of the University faculty members who joined the effort on the home front. 'Miss Ellis was asked to be Canadian Emergency Nursing Adviser to identify nursing priorities, need for hospital staff, for prepared teachers, student enrolment needs (sic). This took her away from campus for a good part of the school year and she had to recruit substitutes for her teaching responsibilities'.\n\nMiss Ellis also served as general secretary for the Canadian Nurses' Association. She became the first president of the Canadian Association of University Schools of Nursing and served on a number of committees, 'including one set up to investigate the possibility of instituting eight-hour days for nurses, and another to determine the plausibility of setting up central school for nursing to make better use of the limited number of instructors. This interest of hers was the seed for the development of the Centralized Teaching Program, instituted in Saskatchewan in 1953'.\n\nDue to her hard work and determination in creating the College and her success in advancing the nursing profession, the building where the College of Nursing is now housed bears her name, Ellis Hall.\n\n",

      "article": "Originally, nurses' uniforms distinguished the trained from the untrained.\n\nThe original uniform for the University of Saskatchewan School of Nursing was 'one-piece, made of white poplin which was starched. It featured tucks down the bodice, a pointed collar, french cuffs and a side fastening down the skirt. The first class of students to be fitted were concerned that the skirt be long enough. Some felt that 14 inches from the floor was too short to be fashionable. White nylon stockings and white oxfords were worn with the uniform and of course, a cap' (Crawford, 1)\n\nNurses today generally wear scrubs in hospital-approved colours with cardigans on the cooler days. Historically, however, nurses were required to conform to a strict dress code in the hospital. The caps they wore were specific to the hospital and were expected to be clean and starched; a black band symbolized that they had passed their registration exams. Uniforms were expected to be clean and were to be changed if for any reason they had become dirty, and shoes were to be clean and white.\n\nThe importance of the uniform is confirmed with a letter from Edith Rutherford to Myrtle Crawford explaining the 'true' facts about the nurses' cap at the University of Saskatchewan School of Nursing. A history written by Miss Crawford explains that the pattern for the cap was based on that of New York University's cap, whereas Miss Rutherford disagrees and offers that it was an original pattern: 'at no time, unless within recent years was another cap, from any School of Nursing examined for ideas. The credit is due to Dr. Lindsay who as you know established the School of Nursing at the 'U of S' and took such an active interest in all the developments of the school'.\n\n",

Nurses were working at any job they could find, housework mostly, and getting just enough money to keep body and soul together. Not only nurses were affected, doctors and lawyers too. Some were out digging ditches, harvesting where there was a crop to be harvested, farm help, and menial job that would give a little cash. There was 'just no money.' In 1939, the beginning of the last great war, things began to pick up little by little. Men were joining the Armed Forces. Doctors and nurses were going into Medical Services'.\n\n\n\nThe depression years across the country brought increased unemployment and economic stagnation. Every group felt the economic squeeze. Nurses were no different. 'In 1930, the drought, with an average precipitation in Saskatchewan of .53 inches for the year, brought increased unemployment among the nurses'. As a result, the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses' Association (SRNA) had to begin to tighten its belt.\n\nAll nurses were hit with reduction of wages and some were even let go by their institutions. 'The private duty nurse was the first to feel the shock of the general belt tightening. Patients, unable to pay for a nurse, relied on hospital nursing care, or, as in the past, neighbours helped each other and the nurse found her income suddenly cut in half and then continued to drop steadily'. Some private duty nurses were fortunate and found jobs elsewhere, but many of them were quite distressed by their unemployment.\n\nThe Depression saw massive unemployment numbers in the nursing profession. However, with the beginning of World War II nurses were joining the armed forces or were going back to work on the homefront. Soon the pendulum swung the other way and it was realized that there were not enough nurses; a shortage that reached its peak in the 1940s.\n\n",

Generally a less-well-known profession, psychiatric nursing has played a role in Saskatchewan's health care history. Saskatchewan's first psychiatric institution was opened in 1914 in North Battleford, Saskatchewan. In 1921, a second institution was opened in Weyburn. By 1929, each institution had 1,000 patients watched over by 'a superintendent and two additional medical officers, and each had a ward staff of about 110 untrained personnel and one registered nurse. There was no formal training program'.\n\nWith the large number of patients problems began accumulating, a commission was then struck by the Government of Saskatchewan to study psychiatric institutions. 'One of their recommendations was for the inauguration of a training school to insure the instruction of the nursing force in the fundamentals of psychology, psychiatry, mental hygiene and medicine. Another was that male student nurses should be given the same training as female nurses, and upon graduation, should be awarded similar diplomas' (Kahan, 1).\n\n'As a result, Ward Attendant Training Programs were begun at both institutions; in North Battleford, the first class graduated in 1932; Weyburn Hospital graduated its first class in 1933 and for the next forty years graduating ceremonies were held each year at Saskatchewan hospitals. In 1937, a number of staff members began a three-year course leading to the Diploma in Psychiatric nursing' (Registered Psychiatric Nurses Association of Saskatchewan, 9)\n\nIn January of 1947, in a meeting of psychiatric nursing graduates, it was voted unanimously to form a professional Psychiatric Nurses' Association (Kahan, 11). A 'committee was elected to study the necessary steps to be taken and to bring in recommendations regarding the aims and objectives of the Association. One of the committee's recommendations was for continual improved training, with emphasis on improved treatment and care for patients in hospitals' (Kahan, 11).\n\nOn March 25, 1948, An Act Respecting the Saskatchewan Psychiatric Nurses' Association was enacted and the association became official. The home of the Registered Psychiatric Nursing Association of Saskatchewan is now on Lorne Street in Regina.\n\n",

It was a no pay job.\n\n\n\nQ: The Weyburn General hospital was accredited as a teaching hospital for RN programs?\n\nE: Yes. I believe the first nurses were trained more or less by the hospital. It wasn’t yet under the provincial government in Saskatchewan. I believe around 1912 most of the nurses were midwives or young people that had been trained by doctors, but in 1924 they gave the first diplomas for nurses trained in Saskatchewan. From 1935 or 36 you no longer could train in any hospital that had less than 75 patients.\n\n\n\nQ: You lived in the nurses residences, beside the hospital?\n\nE: No above it. We were in the attic of the hospital. And it was twenty-four duty. You were on call if you were on the OR, the Operating Room. The way they called you if you were downtown was to turn on the big OR lights, which, with the old Weyburn General being on the hill, you could see all over town.\n\n\n\nQ: So if you were downtown you had to keep an eye on the hill to see if the light was on.\n\nE: If you were the OR nurse and you saw those lights, you were there immediately. And you spent a minimum of three months in the OR. I spent more than that.\n\nYou took your probation training first. And that was four months.\n\nMainly it was book work, theory, how to do things. The practical part so that you could bath patients and could give certain treatments, but not medicines. After the probationary training for four months, during the days, from then on you went on shifts. There were three shifts in the day. They were twelve hours long but were divided. The probationers went on duty at seven in the morning and went off at seven at night, with time for meals and I think they got a half hour off in the afternoon. At maybe nine o’clock you would have a study session, or you would have a lecture session with the doctors as lecturers. We had instructors in addition to the doctors. The instructors came from Winnipeg. There was a Miss Stevenson when we were there. We took classes through the day, but the minute classes were over, you went back on the wards. You carried trays, you carried glasses up to the patients. After the four months that you were supposed to be able to do treatments. In your second year you went on nights, and you could be on nights alone. In your third year, you were supposed to be able to do most everything that was necessary through your training.\n\n\n\nQ: When, if ever, did you get a day off?\n\nE: We didn't get days off. We got a half day off in a week. Six and a half days of 12-hour work days (or nights), with two hours off on Sunday. That didn't count as a half day.\n\nYou couldn't have Christmas or New Year's, or any holiday off, those were considered for the patients. But you got a day off maybe the seventeenth or the eighteenth of December, the week before Christmas. You could go home or you could do what you liked, in place of Christmas.\n\nIf you were sick during your three years training, you had to put in that time after you were through. In those times, a married women was not allowed to work. And not just as a nurse, but practically any job.\n\nI couldn’t be married and work as a nurse. I completed my RN exams the summer of 1935 and had been working in the hospital for a year after that when we were married.\n\nI had graduated so I could get married, but according to the law I couldn’t work. There weren’t enough jobs to go around, that was the way they looked at it. But I was called back, temporarily, numerous times afterwards.\n\nAfter I had my RN, after I left the hospital, after I was married and living on the farm. Dr. Good called to say he had a patient, really bad, a heart condition and I don’t know what else. He was quite an elderly man. Dr. Good wanted me to come to Yellow Grass to keep an eye on him for two or three days. He got better and came along fine. When it came to paying for it, they gave my husband a small pig.

Today, over one thousand students are enrolled in the Nursing Education Program at the University of Saskatchewan. The program has grown and changed significantly since its small beginnings.\n\nNursing was established as a school of nursing under the direction of Kathleen Ellis in 1938. The school achieved college status in 1973 - a time when nursing education in general was changing from a hands-on, hospital-based training program to a college-based, academic program with limited practicum work. During the same year, the Bachelor of Science degree in nursing was introduced. Students would no longer receive an Arts degree and nursing training, but a degree in their actual field of study.\n\nThe College currently offers a three or four-year nursing education program (depending on the number of prerequisites the students have) in three cities across the province: Saskatoon, Regina and Prince Albert. The program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing. Nurses wishing to continue their education at the Master's level can also do so at the University of Saskatchewan with either a thesis or course-based program. The College also offers a Native Access Program to Nursing which the College of Nursing describes as 'a support and retention service for Aboriginal nursing students.'\n\nBecause the College is committed to continuing nursing education, it offers opportunities for professional development and other continuing education programs.\n\n",

      "article": "Irene Sutherland, the first Air Ambulance flight nurse, had an interesting first day on the job. It is recounted in a 1960 Edition of Saskatchewan News:\n\n\n\nIrene, who had never flown before, was sitting in the cabin of a Norseman aircraft, headed north over the prairie.\n\nThey landed on a farmer's field near Balcarres, and her first aerial patient was brought aboard. He was a farmer with an injured leg. Normally, it wouldn't have been a serious matter, but gangrene had set in and was spreading. He had to reach a hospital quickly. The Norseman made a fast turn-around and took off for Regina.\n\nIn the cabin with her patient Irene was immediately aware that this was different from anything she'd encountered in her career as a graduate nurse. She was at home in brilliantly-lit, well equipped and spacious wards. She was accustomed to the clinical quiet of a modern hospital.\n\nNow she found herself at work in the cramped space of an airplane cabin. Equipment was at a minimum. Outside, the aircraft engine beat a steady accompaniment to her work. It was a turbulent day and the patient's bunk was by no means as steady as a standard hospital bed.\n\nThere was another difference. In hospital work, a nurse always knows that if there's trouble, she can count on help. There are doctors, interns, supervisors and other nurses to turn to. Here she was completely on her own. It was at first a chilling sensation. Irene gave her patient a hypodermic to ease his pain. She managed to keep him reasonably comfortable in the 40-minute flight. When they landed, she was conscious of the fact that she'd met the first challenge of her new career. It was a stimulating experience' (Saskatchewan News , April 1960).\n\n\n\nSaskatchewan's Air Ambulance service was able to boast that it was the only one of its kind in the world for almost two decades. 'The Saskatchewan Air Ambulance Service began as the wartime dream of 26 year old RCAF pilot, Flight Lieutenant Keith Malcolm. Australian pilots had told him of Australia's Flying Doctor Service which brings the doctor to the patient. The service envisaged by Malcolm brought the patient to the doctor' (Saskatchewan Air Ambulance Service: A Historical Sketch). Patients in need of emergency transport could rely on Saskatchewan's Air Ambulance Service to take them to various hospitals both within and outside of the province. There were some places in the province that were impossible to reach by road ambulance and others that were too far away to receive help quickly enough. Physicians would be able to call for the Air Ambulance to transport these patients in an efficient manner.\n\n'The Saskatchewan Air Ambulance Service was formed in Feb. 1946, and by March 31 1974 had flown 22,441 mercy missions, logging almost seven million miles. This is roughly 15 trips to the moon and back or - put another way - 280 trips around the world' (History - see above reference). The service only carried a pilot and a flight nurse. No physicians were on board. All services performed in the air were done by nurses willing to work in less-than-perfect conditions. Flight nurses thus became the backbone of the Air Ambulance service.\n\n",

      "article": "Sunshine, bed rest and good food were the key therapies for Tuberculosis patients prior to the introduction of antibiotics and Sulpha drugs. Nurses would try and keep the patients healthy by taking them outside for fresh air. They would make sure that they ate properly and received enough bed rest. Some nurses did catch the disease, but most, remarkably, stayed healthy while caring for the very sick patients either in hospital wards or in any number of the province's sanatoriums. Most nurses were eventually vaccinated against the disease. But they still had to be careful.\n\nGeorgiana Chartier remembers her time at the Saskatoon Sanatorium:\n\n\n\n'In the sanatorium -- actually, the care at that time was bed rest, good food, etcetera. I can't remember whether the -- don't know if it was sulphonomide or penicillin that was given for -- it may have been penicillin. And I don't know if it had just started then because you're -- remember this is just after the first -- Second World War, and penicillin didn't come in, I think, until towards the end of it. So I'm not sure whether they were treating it -- at that time it was bed rest, good food, etcetera. But I think -- I think it might have been penicillin they were treating them with. I'm not absolutely positive. But some of them went home for productive lives, some didn't. It's like everything else. I think we lost a young child there when I was there. She -- it went onto, oh gosh, I can't even think of the name of the thing, but she died when I was there, and she was just a young little child. But they were -- patients were flown into the san from northern Saskatchewan. I think Fort san existed too. There were two sans, if I remember correctly. Fort San and then the sanatorium here in Saskatoon. They did surgery here, etcetera. And it was interesting. We were -- had classes, etcetera, and I think we were there for about nine weeks. And we lived in residence at the sanatorium. There was a san -- a residence there, and we just went over to the san. And you did all the nursing care that you would have done in an ordinary hospital. And they had -- you used to call it a veranda, and they believed in the fresh air, etcetera, for sanatorium patients. So they'd go out into this veranda, cold or not, but their beds could be moved out, and we could even sleep out. I think there was even a veranda in the residence that you could sleep, you know, in the outdoors type thing. But I don't remember much more. Just trying to think of the san as it was. It was fully staffed. There was a doctor's residence. Actually, the old Bar Room and House, which is a historical site in Saskatoon was the senior doctors, which was Dr. Bouton at the time. And there were three or four houses for the doctors along that street, Avenue K, and this is where they lived. So they lived right on site practically. They had an OR, and I can't remember anything else. The food was the best we ever had though in three years. I can tell you that. It was -- we enjoyed it very much, all of us I'm sure. But we did have classes when we were there too, and there were nurses from Regina. I believe there was a nursing school in PA at the time, and there were some classmates from there, and I think Moose Jaw. There were different schools that came up. And it was very interesting' (Interview: Geogiana Chartier)\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "Saskatchewan's north is a beautiful place. Small, remote towns dot the treed landscape, cut off from one another and the rest of the province by crystal-clear lakes and dense forest. While the landscape is of almost unparalleled beauty, it is difficult to develop and thus is not heavily populated. There has always been a medical presence in northern Saskatchewan but physicians are hard to come by and there is a heavier reliance on nurses to provide medical care.\n\nNurses practising in Northern Saskatchewan, although they often practice solo, generally enjoy their work. Because they are often the only medical personnel in small communities, nurses are able to use the full scope of their abilities. They have to deal with everything from educating the public on preventive care to emergency treatment of injuries. Physicians are always available by telephone but nurses do have to make decisions that can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nBonnie Kalk, a psychiatric nurse who worked in northern Saskatchewan, remembers that working in the north requires a certain cultural sensitivity. She was one of only three Registered Psychiatric Nurses working in northern Saskatchewan at the time. Many nurses who travel from southern to northern Saskatchewan have to adapt to a different way of life. They cannot impose their views on the existing cultures and traditional values of the northern communities. Kalk says that some nurses adapted better than others and those who did found it much easier to fit into the communities where they were working. Kalk learned much about her own spirituality from the people in the north  She sees much value in their traditional ways. (Interview with Bonnie Kalk).\n\nPhyllis Austman remembers one instance of a forest fire when she was the lone nurse in the community of Sandy Bay. Usually there were two nurses working in the community but one had gone to visit family before the fire had become a threat. Austman was nervous about the possibility of having to evacuate on a boat but she proceeded to pack the essential medical supplies for the trip. It happened that the village did not need to be completely evacuated because of a change in the wind, so Austman instead had to treat those who were scratched and bruised from helping to fight the fire (Video Clip Phyllis Austman - roughly 3:30 about people praying for them).\n\n",

      "title": "Nursing Service Hours by Students",
      "article": "In their training, nursing students were put to the test early on. Hospital schools made nurses work hard in return for their training and monthly stipend. In 1957, for example, nursing students at the University of Saskatchewan provided 226,884 hours of service for University Hospital (scan memo). Students spent 19,180 hours in the operating room, 15,424 hours in the delivery room and 5,220 hours doing dietary work. 187,060 hours were spent in 'other nursing service hours.'\n\nGeorgiana Chartier remembers her time as a nursing student at St. Paul's Hospital in Saskatoon:\n\n\n\nWell, in 1950, you'd go on wards as a student nurse. It started at Christmas. I started in September, so we were on wards in December. You were a proby. You also took classes, so you could very well go on duty, and then you'd have to go off, go over to an hour or so of class, and go back on duty again. In 1952, they changed to a system called the block system. So we got all our third year classes in our second year. So we were strictly on wards in our last year of training. I guess it was done to clear the way for the next classes so that they could take the block system, so we were out of the way and it had worked very well. So all of our last years were in -- on, like, a practically regular nurse on the wards. I went into the OR as you would call a junior assistant. So that was till I finished training, and then I went on staff at St. Paul's. You gave bed baths. You changed beds. You would learn to give meds. You did all those things. As you practiced -- you had -- part of your training was -- the classroom training, was your Nursing Arts, I think it was called, and Mary T. MacKenzie taught that class. And you were taught to do all the procedures, etcetera. You didn't change dressings. Dressings at those -- in those days were change -- done by the central dressing room. They did the whole hospital. It's a very different place.\n\nUsing nursing students as labour benefited the whole hospital. Nursing students at this time (especially in the individual hospital schools) would have room and board and books paid for in return for their work on the wards. This helped even the poorest of aspiring nurses to gain their education and helped the hospital to keep costs low. This is perhaps one of the reasons that nursing remained a profession open to most who wished to learn. It did not become an education simply for the elite as many professions did with increases in educational tuition. The tradition of educating nurses on the basis of training repayment showed a commitment to the values of the profession.\n\n",

      "article": "When one thinks of nursing training in the early twentieth century, one thinks of nursing students in hospitals providing menial labour in return for their education. This is how nurses were trained. After their training, nurses would find work in hospitals or in private duty nursing. A select few would brave the unknown and travel to northern Saskatchewan. Some young women, perhaps not able to do the full nursing program, took the Training Course for Nursing Housekeepers, a one-year course designed to 'supply a body of women who shall be ready and able to assist in the care of the home as well as in the care of the sick.' (Nursing Housekeeper Pamphlet)\n\nDesigned to meet the needs of rural and remote Saskatchewan, graduates from this course would be suited to work in Northern and rural Saskatchewan. These were not often desired destinations for many nurses. Nursing housekeepers were trained not only in the art of caring for patients in the home, but also to assist physicians in the absence of a registered nurse:\n\nInstruction will be given in the care of the sick room, the care of bed patients, and in all of the simple nursing procedures. Instruction will also be given in the care of infants and young children, in the hygiene of pregnancy, and in the care of the mother and newborn infant. While it is not intended that Registered Nursing Housekeepers shall supersede Registered Nurses in the care of obstetrical patients, the Nursing Housekeeper shall receive such training as will enable her intelligently to assist the physicians in the absence of a Registered Nurse.\n\nNursing housekeepers, while not a well-recognized part of Saskatchewan's past, need to be recognized as brave pioneers of Saskatchewan's remote and sometimes desolate rural areas. Young women, barely having left the comforts of their parents' homes, would travel to the most remote parts of the province to tend to those in need of care.\n\n",

      "title": "The Centralized Teaching Program",
      "article": "In the 1940s, many institutions did not have sufficient staff to teach the basic sciences to their nursing students. The programs suffered because of it. Staff shortages made it difficult for nurses to teach in addition to their ward duties. This shortage prompted the Saskatchewan government to establish a Health Survey Committee. The committee recognized this nursing shortage and recommended that nursing education be centralized and largely de-linked from nursing practice. Fully centralizing nursing training would not have been feasible, but centralizing the learning of basic sciences was a viable option. The Saskatchewan Registered Nurses' Association (SRNA) approached the government and suggested a program which centralized the teaching of basic sciences as 'each year it was becoming recognized in Saskatchewan that the teaching of the basic sciences was the weakest point in nursing education programs' (Steering Committee, 10). Several hospitals were having difficulty securing teaching staff for the basic sciences and the idea of centralizing these courses seemed an appropriate solution to the problem.\n\n'In September of 1952, a request for financial support to initiate a plan of centralized nursing education was submitted to the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. The request was granted and a sum of money was provided on a three-year commitment to establish, at Regina College and the University of Saskatchewan, a sixteen weeks' introductory program for basic nursing students' (Schmitt, 2). The money from the Kellogg foundation could not be used for books or desks or any other supplies, so nurses pulled together and donated either money or equipment for the new schools.\n\nThe program was inaugurated in 1953. 'The new pattern represented a provisional step in the planned improvement of the total curriculum in basic nursing education. It demonstrated a means of sharing much needed facility personnel and thus provided a measure of assistance to the strengthening of existing schools' (Schmitt, 2).\n\nHospital schools retained control over their students, however. The various schools in the province still practiced their own recruiting and admitting. If the faculty in the centralized teaching program felt that a student should not continue training, a recommendation to remove the student would be made to the home school of nursing. The home school of nursing would then make the decision as to whether the student would continue.\n\nThe program was a precursor to the centralized programs that Saskatchewan provides presently for its nursing students.\n\n",

      "article": "'It was a terrible epidemic everywhere. And they really didn't know what caused polio. They didn't know how it was transmitted, and they, therefore, didn't know how to protect people' (Interview: Lucy Willis)\n\nIn the early 1950s, Saskatchewan experienced a polio epidemic. Polio patients were kept in isolation units in hospitals across the province, sometimes having to be flown there from smaller centres. Nurses, primary caregivers for polio patients, were putting themselves in danger as there was no immunity or vaccinations for the disease at the time.\n\nPolio was not a disease that struck one segment of the population - everyone was susceptible. Georgiana Chartier, a nurse in training in St. Paul's Hospital at the time of the epidemic remembers going home at the end of the day with an ache or a pain in the leg and wondering if she had caught the disease.\n\nShe also recounts a heart-wrenching story of one of the deaths from polio in the isolation unit: 'That was very sad. It was weird because it was just a young girl. She must have been six or seven. And before we were going off for supper, she wanted -- she was in the lung, and she was talking to somebody, and she had -- I don't know if it was a doll or a toy, and she wanted to give it away. And it was kind of weird because we went for supper and there were other people on, and we came back and she had died in the -- at that -- I think before we got back. And it was sad because you had to, you know, have her parents come in to see her type thing and it was tough, you know. But we didn't -- I don't remember a lot of deaths, like when we were there. I think the main epidemic may have been over at that time, to tell the truth' (Interview: Georgiana Chartier)\n\nChartier does not remember many deaths from the disease; many of the patients she met in the isolation ward recovered and went on to live productive lives. But there were a few who didn't make it, like the little girl she will never forget.\n\n",

And why it was there...you used air pressure from a pump, an electric pump, and it put pressure on the patient's body that caused the lungs to - it pressed on the lungs, caused airr to go out, and then it caused a vacuum and air went in. So it was solely there to provide this pressure. And it was called an iron lung because it was a big old iron thing with a pump attached' (Interview: Lucy Willis).\n\nPolio could paralyze the diaphragm, making it extremely difficult for its victims to breathe. Patients would be put into an iron lung to help them breathe and would not come out until they could breathe on their own again.\n\nLucy Willis, former dean of the College of Nursing at the University of Saskatchewan, remembers the polio epidemic and that isolation rooms were packed with polio victims so tight that the iron lungs had to be housed in the hallways. She worked fourteen to sixteen hours a day looking after the polio unit, with help from a regular staff and volunteers. While she learned a lot working in the polio unit, she would not like to repeat the experience, describing it as desperate. Nurses could not spend a large amount of time with each patient due to the number of patients.\n\nWillis remembers a young boy who had to be in an iron lung.\n\n\n\n'I remember a young lad named Rosea. He was about maybe nine, somewhere around there not any older. Big brown eyes, a beautiful little boy. And he had been flown in and he was in an iron lung. And his mother came in with him. But I remember Ms. Keeler, who was the Director of Nursing at the university. She came in and she looked at Rosea many times. And she said that Rosea said to her he wanted his legs massaged. And that was one thing you could do. You could take the thing off and let them breath a little bit for a while and massage them. And I guess she'd done this about six times already in about two hours, and he asked again, and she said, Oh, Rosea, I just did it. And he said, Just one more time. So she did it. He was a very appealing little boy. The thing about him was that his mother came in with him by air ambulance, and we were so busy, that mother was there with him for about two days. And I was going into the nurses' lunchroom and going to have a cup of coffee, and I asked her if she'd like to come in and have a cup of coffee and she started to cry. And I wondered what was wrong, so I said, Well, tell me what's wrong. And she said, I haven't had anything to eat for two days. I came in in the air ambulance. I didn't bring any money. And we were so busy we hadn't noticed that she hadn't left the child. So -- and it was Sunday morning, and I thought, I've got to do something for this poor mother. So I phoned the Catholic Welfare -- what do they call it? Catholic Social Service or whatever and Sister O'Brian was in charge of that and we all knew her. She was wonderful. I phoned there and she answered on the first ring. And I told her what had happened. I said, I have this woman and she needs some help and what -- can you do something? And she said, Yes. So she came right down. And she said to me, How did you know I'd be there? And I said, I didn't. I just hoped. And she said, I just walked into the office to pick up a book and the phone rang. So she took her and found her a place to stay and got her looked after. But that was kind of a miracle I thought. So Rosea is very much a memory of that time. There were lots of others like that, but he was one (Interview: Lucy Willis).\n\n",

One such nurse is Mary Pyne. Raised in small-town Saskatchewan, Mary travelled far and wide with her nursing career spending time in Portugal, Angola and Zaire, teaching nursing students in the African countries and learning much about other cultures.\n\nMary sailed from Montreal to Lisbon in 1956. She stayed in Portugal for just over a year to learn the language and arrived in Angola on New Year's Day, 1958. Teaching in Angola was not all the work that Mary did in Angola. Refugees would often knock at her door in search of medical assistance. Since she could speak their language while workers in the emergency rooms could not, she would go with them and translate so that they could receive the medical assistance they needed.\n\nMary remembers some of the different diseases that she saw in Angola and Zaire that were different from those one would see in Saskatchewan. She saw quite a bit of malaria and a large number of parasites. She also remembers that because of the number of snake-bite cases, the hospital usually carried snake venom, something not generally found in Saskatchewan hospitals.\n\nBecause the hospital did not serve food, people who came in from the villages would set up fires outside of the hospital and cook their own food. She does remember the hospital in Angola as being quite well-equipped with modern machines such as an electrocardiograph. Mary's job was to teach students to use the equipment as well as teaching them to care for a patient with only a minimum of equipment\n\nMary also travelled to the villages to practise some of her nursing there. She loved the people in Africa and felt like a part of their communities and families. In spite of the long work days, Mary looks back on her time overseas with great fondness.\n\n\n\n'In Angola I loved to go and visit the villages, the people were very, very hospitable. But usually we would go out to immunize and we would immunize probably five hundred children in one days work. So we would go out at 7:00 o'clock in the morning and we would be there until we finished those immunizations which would be late in the evening. And so the people came very willing to be immunized and after we were all, had completed the immunization in the last village, the people would make us some food. And I can remember seeing a very skinny chicken going by the school window where we were immunizing and thinking, I am so hungry I could eat that chicken. But the people in the villages, usually when we came there, they would begin to sing and they would sing songs of welcome. Often the people were very poor. They were just barely making a living from their fields, most of their livelihood was agriculture but some of the villages, they even had sheep and they spun wool and that was unusual. But all of this disappeared with the war, all this wonderful life in the villages, disappeared with the war because people had to flee. They had to flee to Lawanda, the capital and a lot of them lost their farms and the life they had had before.'\n\n' The war began in, well there was some conflict in '74 but around '76 the war erupted and it kept on for nearly 30 years. At the same time, at the time the war was going on in Angola, I was in Zaire and we were only 50 miles, no, we were only 50 kilometers from the border of Angola and quite often we could hear the Portuguese shelling the border villages at night. And then the next day we would have people come in from land mine accidents or from other, from shelling and so we had a big hospital there, we had a 400 bed hospital in Zaire. In Angola the hospital was almost that large, was almost 400 and so sometimes I remember things about Angola that took, are, that took place when I was in Zaire, so I sometimes mix up the two.

While nurses enter their profession for a variety of reasons, compassion and caring are what keep them there.\n\nSome nurses enter the profession because a family member was a nurse - they remember a mother or aunt tending to the sick and remember the beginnings of a commitment to a nursing career. Phyllis Austman, a long time Saskatchewan nurse, remembers her mother riding the railways from town to town caring for the ill. Her mother's dedication to nursing instilled in Phyllis a desire to enter the profession. Mary Pyne, a nurse from a small town, followed in the footsteps of two of her Aunts; one of whom was a nurse and the other a midwife. One of the aunts, Mary, was always loved well respected as a nurse. Belle, the midwife had learned her skills on the job.\n\nOther nurses realized at a young age that they enjoyed caring for people and realized that nursing would be a way to incorporate this into their working life. Some had cared for aging parents or grandparents, and had simply recognized a desire to help people. Georgiana Chartier received inspiration from her mother: 'my mother was -always wanted to be a nurse. As the youngest of the family... and she was supposed to be looking after her parents, so she didn't really have a career. Of course, we're talking 1920s, and it was a whole different world. And I guess she was encouraging me. My grandmother was a diabetic, so I learned to give insulin when I was about eleven. And I guess it just sort of went from there that nursing became my choice.

      "article": "Traveling to Saskatoon from a small town in Saskatchewan, Mary Parchewsky began her nurses training in September of 1950 at St. Paul's Hospital. Mary loved residence life and feels she owes St. Paul's for the educational experience that they gave her. She says at the time she may not have enjoyed all of the strict rules and regulations governing her, but she looks back now and realizes that her experience there fostered in her a sense of self-discipline.\n\nAfter graduating, Mary worked in obstetrics for a few years before signing up for a course in labour and delivery in Jersey City. She stayed at the training hospital for a number of years after she finished the course and became head nurse for the night shift. Mary remembers her time in the United States as one where she traveled and learned quite a bit. However, when her mother became ill with tuberculosis in 1957, Mary came back to Saskatchewan to take care of her mother. She returned to St. Paul's Hospital for work and within two months was made head nurse on her ward. At that time, hospital nurses were forming Staff Nursing Associations (SNAs); Mary became the president of the St. Paul's SNA.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court decision was handed down that the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses' Association could no longer provide collective bargaining services for nurses, Mary became the chair of the nurses' bargaining committee. At the time, she had been taking an industrial relations course. She went to her professor and asked for advice as to what to do in this situation. Her professor gave her two options: one, nurses could decide to join an existing union, or; two, start their own organization. The nurses decided that they would create their own organization in January of 1974. The next decision was what the new union would call itself. Mary remembers there being a name suggested that was quite good, but abbreviated to SIN. After quite a few suggestions, Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN) was selected as the new union's name.\n\nMary was elected first president of SUN. At that time, the SUN presidency was to be done in addition to any work in hospital. Mary worked as a nurse the entire time she was SUN president.\n\n\n\n",

Goodwill went on to pursue and incredible career based on a bicultural view of the health care system:\n\n\n\nGoodwill was sensitive to the traditions of Aboriginal peoples in a way that the non-native nurses were not. Goodwill hoped that nurses of Native ancestry could reinforce the healing traditions and beliefs of Aboriginal peoples while at the same time making available the best that modern nursing could offer to Aboriginal communities' (Drees and McBain, 61).\n\n\n\nGoodwill began her career in Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan and then moved to a head nurse position at the LaRonge nursing station. After a brief time working in Bermuda, her work focused on ensuring appropriate health services for Aboriginal communities; for their cultural traditions and social conditions. To this end, Goodwill was a member of many committees and associations:\n\n\n\nShe was executive director of the India-Métis Friendship Centre in Winnipeg, head of the Department of Indian Health Studies at the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College of the University of Regina, a member of the Aboriginal Women's Association of Canada, to name but a few. She was also a founding member of the Aboriginal Nurses Association of Canada, where she served as president for seven years' (Library and Archives Canada).\n\n\n\nGoodwill was also involved in politics, becoming the first Aboriginal woman to be appointed special advisor to the minister of National Health and Welfare.\n\nGoodwill's exceptional career and commitment to Aboriginal health earned her several prestigious distinctions. The Manitoba Nurses Association created the Jean Goodwill Award. Goodwill received the award in 1981. She received an honourary Doctorate of Law degree from Queen's University in 1986 and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1992.\n\nJean goodwill was a role model for all Saskatchewan nurses. Her focus on Aboriginal health was much needed work. Goodwill passed away in 1997.\n\n",

      "title": "Psychiatric Nursing: Differences from Registered Nursing",
      "article": "Although training for registered nursing and registered psychiatric nursing begins in the same way, the differences begin to show themselves later in training and through the practicums in various facilities.\n\nBonnie Kalk, a long-time registered psychiatric nurse, describes some of the differences between the two types of nursing. The first that she mentions is that psychiatric nurses have to be able to accept people for who they are. Some of the patients that psychiatric nurses see will not change with treatment. While all nurses have to show this characteristic of acceptance to some extent, Kalk maintains that a psychiatric nurse does see some 'quirky' behaviour and so this acceptance is of the utmost importance. This is why, she explains, that most nurses, if given a choice, would often choose another type of nursing. Psychiatric nursing is really quite a challenging profession because of the personalities that encounter. have to be dealt with.\n\nPsychiatric nurses also have much autonomy and quick decisions often need to be made. Mistakes can be made and this is always a challenge to the professional.\n\nMental health also is not always on the top of budget lists and thus working conditions are not always the best. However, as Kalk mentions, it is not so much the working conditions but the people that count. The patients are the most important part of the profession.\n\nBonnie points out that her psychiatric nursing was like living in a small community since many of the patients where there for a very long time, and “at least the patients felt like they belonged and that they had their jobs and fit in, so to speak.  The one that I mentioned in the other documentary always wore a Boy Scout uniform.  His job was to greet people at the hospital when they came, and people tell the story of when Tommy Douglas came to visit the hospital, and Winston was in his Boy Scout uniform, shorts and whatnot, and said hello to him and asked him his name, and he said, well, I'm Tommy Douglas, the Premier of the Province.  Winston said, ‘well, that's okay, he say, there's people here think they're Napoleon’, he said, you can just come in anyway. So it was like a therapeutic community.”\n\nBonnie also pointed out that “we had a lot of autonomy as psych nurses where I worked. The challenge was really to be able to make quick decisions and do what needed doing right then and there, and that teaches you because you make mistakes and then you learn from them.  That's how it seemed to me, that you just had to decide what you were going to do and that -- that's -- that can be quite a challenge too.  And I'm sure that that's the same for all nurses; that they have to function in life and death situations many, many times, and they have to decide like right now what they're going to do”\n\n“Well, I think the first thing that comes to my mind is you have to be sort of suited to be excepting and be able to except people just as they are.  Now, I'm not saying the other -- that all nurses don't do that, but you do run into some fairly quirky behaviors in people that are, you know, don't know who they are and where they are”\n\n",

Winter created problems which effectively isolated some northern communities. First, it could get very cold which would cause problems for many residents in their day-to-day living. Second, for patients that needed to be evacuated to larger centres with better equipped hospitals, large amounts of snow could create great difficulty for getting into or out of the community.\n\nAustman remembers some of her more trying times as a nurse in a small northern community. She remembers many attempted suicides and three that were 'successful.' Deaths in the smaller towns were difficult as everyone knew one another and had for a long time.\n\nNurses were often the sole health care provider in town (traditional healers notwithstanding). This meant that any possible health problem could walk through their door. Nurses working solo have to have confidence in their decision-making ability as their judgment can mean the difference between life and death. But nursing alone also can pose problems to a nurse's safety - Austman remembers being put into a 'choke hold' late one evening by a man who was intoxicated.\n\nDespite some of the trials of her time in the north, Austman looks back on the experience fondly. She remembers working closely with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), teachers and elders to create a better community. Furthermore, she remembers that the people were wonderful and friendly and even though Saskatoon was her real home, the people in the small villages where she worked made her feel at home there too.\n\n",

      "article": "During the 1950s, Saskatchewan Psychiatrists Humphry Osmond and Abram Hoffer reported unprecedented recovery rates for alchoholics. Their method? D-lysergic acid diethylamide, more familiarly known as LSD.\n\nAn article published in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry states:\n\n\n\nearly trials indicated that the drug had the potential to improve mental health care, advancing a theory that explained mental illness as the manifestation of metabolic functions. This assertion pointed to the possibility that mental illness was inherently a biological entity and thus could be studied and ultimately treated with the latest medical technology...In a province committed to establishing sweeping health care reforms, the mere possibility that Saskatchewan-based researchers might be developing cures for mental illness generated unparalleled political support (Dyck, 384). The primary idea was to use LSD as a curative therapy, but secondarily it was given to health care workers in an attempt to gain insight into the mind of the mentally ill. Osmond first tested the effects of the drug on himself. It was thought that the heightened awareness brought on by the drug would increase workers' empathy for their patients.\n\n\n\nIn Regina, some nurses in the Monroe Wing of the Regina General Hospital took LSD for the purposes of these experiments. Approximately ten nurses took the drug while they were heavily supervised. Bonnie Kalk explains that the experience was really quite a positive one because it did provide insight that could not be gained any other way. Similar experiments were also carried out at the Weyburn Hospital.\n\nAfter the rise of LSD as a street drug and a number of cases of LSD-induced criminal acts, the drug was banned as an illegal substance in the United States. Experiments thus ceased in the late 1960s. However, there are still those who argue that LSD works as both a curative therapy and a way to create more empathy for patients amongst health care workers.\n\n\n\n",

In 1944, the CCF gained power in Saskatchewan and Premier Douglas made it his priority to introduce state-sponsored medical care. It was not until 18 years later that his dream would become reality. Physicians were adamantly opposed to state-sponsored medical care and delayed the process considerably. When the government did finally decide to go ahead, many physicians withdrew services. To take the place of striking physicians, the government imported doctors from Great Britain.\n\nOf course, not all of Saskatchewan's physicians withdrew their services - some were in favour of medicare. Those that were in favour of the program grouped together and opened community clinics. Many of these clinics are still in existence today.\n\nEventually the other physicians did go back to work, finally accepting the medicare program, although there were some that left the province for good and others that did not return to practice. Many of the physicians brought as stand-ins from Great Britain stayed.\n\nThe implementation of medicare affected the entire population. Some citizens were passionate about medicare and some were passionate in opposing it. Others who needed medical care during the famous doctors' strike could not get the care that they needed. Some hospitals even required patients to sign a release form that released the hospital of its responsibility should the patient not receive proper care. Finally, the strike and the beginnings of medicare affected other health care workers, including the nurses.\n\n",

      "article": "Although the doctors' strike is a large part of Saskatchewan's medicare history, nurses, surprisingly, did not take a partisan role in the conflict. The Saskatchewan Registered Nurses' Association (SRNA) urged nurses to decide for themselves where their loyalties lay. Some nurses were in favour of implementing the medicare scheme while others were adamantly opposed, taking part in the Keep Our Doctor Committees (KODs). The implementation of medicare did not even merit close attention in The First Fifty Years , the history of the first fifty years of the SRNA.\n\nThe fact that medicare was such a non-issue for nurses is interesting in itself. While the whole province was in turmoil over a change to the health care system as it had existed for decades, nurses showed professional integrity and stayed in at work. They did not walk off the job in support of doctors, but rather picked up the slack in hospitals and dealt with the large numbers of patients who needed medical care.\n\nGeorgiana Chartier, a nurse, remembers being outraged at the hospital's treatment of patients during this time. Her son had been out playing in the campground where the family was vacationing and had taken quite a vicious fall. His mother, being a nurse, automatically thought of all of the things that could have been wrong with her son due to his injury and thus rushed him to St. Paul's Hospital in Saskatoon. Chartier remembers her feelings at the time:\n\n\n\n'And there was a form I had to sign before they would care for him, and it was literally, to me, the way I read it, was that if anything goes wrong, nobody was responsible. So I signed the form. But then in brackets, I put 'under duress,' which made me very unpopular...I thought that this was against their oath...that you're literally leaving your patients...I didn't think it was right, and I guess it was this sort of thing that you took an oath to look after people. You didn't leave them like that. I guess I found it sort of against what you were supposed to be doing. You were caring for the sick and there were oaths that you took to care for your patients' (Interview: Georgiana Chartier).\n\n\n\nWhile Chartier's views are not representative of all nurses, they do reflect some of the frustrations at the time.\n\n",

She graduated from St. Paul's School of Nursing in Saskatoon in 1969; a member of the very last class to come out of St. Paul's. Junor enjoyed her nursing training, but did not enjoy the rules and regulations that came with it. Nursing students were required to live in residence, even those who had been living in Saskatoon. In the late sixties, a time when many youths were finding freedom, nursing students were still required to adhere to strict and early curfews. There were also very strict rules about dating. Students could not wash their hair immediately prior to a date because it would be too sexually stimulating to do so. A deck of cards was to be taken just in case there was nothing to do. Urine samples were taken monthly to determine if any of the students was pregnant. The samples were tested unbeknownst to students. At the time, Junor remembers wondering how the nuns would know that a student was pregnant before even the student did. Although Junor reflects fondly on the actual nursing training, she remembers being very unhappy living in residence and became the first student able to live at home.\n\nAfter finishing her nursing training, Junor worked in obstetrics at City Hospital in Saskatoon. She loved working on this unit and loved her profession in general. In 1977, Junor quit to spend time with her young children, but went back to nursing in 1986 after taking a refresher course. Before taking the time to spend with her family, the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN) had just come into existence and Junor had not been active in the union. When she came back to nursing, she became the SUN ward representative and eventually was talked into being the secretary for the union local. From this point, her union career seemed to take very logical steps. She ran for president of the local in 1991 and in 1993 was asked to run for presidency of the provincial union.\n\nJunor enjoyed her time as president of SUN, commenting that she liked the idea of moving nursing forward in the public eye. In 1998, she was approached to run for politics. As of 2005, Junor still works as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). As an elected official, Junor is in a unique position with respect to the health care field because of her experience as a front-line health worker. She enjoys the fact that health personnel can come to her knowing that she has worked in a hospital and knows some of the issues from that side Being the first nurse to enter politics as an MLA, Junor has been an asset to the government with her intimate knowledge of the health care system.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Introduction of Collective Bargaining to Saskatchewan (Staff Nurses Associations)",
      "article": "In the full scope of nursing history, collective bargaining is a relatively new phenomenon. For a long time, the words 'collective bargaining' and 'union' were almost unspeakable in nursing circles. In Saskatchewan, collective bargaining units did not exist until the 1960s when Staff Nursing Associations (SNAs) were formed. SNAs were created as bodies through which nurses could express grievances.   Representatives from the SNAs would sit on bargaining committees and would take grievances from nurses to the hospital administration.\n\nAn SNA could be formed only if the majority of nurses employed in a hospital voted in favour of establishing a bargaining unit. Then, once an SNA was formed it had to get recognition from the employer. This could be achieved in one of two ways: voluntary recognition or certification. Voluntary recognition meant the employer would voluntarily recognize the SNA's right to bargain on behalf of the hospital's nurses and would enter into negotiations. But, if the employer was opposed to collective bargaining and refused to recognize the SNA, then the SNA would have to apply to the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board asking the Board to exercise it's authority under the Trade Union Act to declare the SNA an appropriate bargaining unit. If the application was approved, the employer would be required by the act to recognize the SNA and would be compelled to participate in negotiations (Slater-Smith, 15).\n\nSeeing the need for a stronger collective bargaining agent, the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association (SRNA) created the position of Employment Relations Officer in 1967. 'The job was primarily to represent nurses in employment matters but also involved teaching nurses about the process of collective bargaining and participating in contract negotiations' (Slater-Smith, 14). Ann Sutherland, a nursing consultant, was hired to do the job.\n\n\n\nAs Sutherland absorbed the intricacies of labour relations, the SRNA hired a Calgary labour consultant, Ken Barrass, to prepare the groundwork for provincial collective bargaining. Seminars held in four major centres in October, 1967, attracted about 1,000 nurses who heard the advantages of bargaining explained by Barrass and the Canadian Nurses' Association's social and economic welfare consultant, Glenna Roswell of Ottawa. Barrass told nurses there was nothing wrong with the collective bargaining process, provided the exercise was performed in an intelligent and ethical manner. He cautioned nurses against behaviour associated with irresponsible trade union performance and said nurses should make their requests in a reasonable and logical fashion validated by facts. He stressed he did not want to be associated with strike action by nurses (Slater-Smith, 14).\n\n\n\nNurses found their voice through the establishment of their SNAs. From that point, collective bargaining for nurses in Saskatchewan underwent a rapid evolution until 1974 when nurses, under their newly minted union, took job action for the first time.\n\n",

      "article": "In October of 1973, the Supreme Court of Canada decided that Staff Nursing Associations (SNAs) 'could not be certified as bargaining agents if the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses' Association (SRNA) was involved in their formation or operation' (You Can't Eat Dedication: A History of the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses, Slater-Smith, 24). In the original battle, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) took a complaint to the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board, 'and argued that the Nipawin SNA should not be certified because the SRNA would be its bargaining agent and the SRNA's executive council was dominated by nurses holding management positions. How could an organization led by nurses who held management jobs adequately represent the interests of staff nurses?' (Slater-Smith, 22).\n\nFollowing this groundbreaking decision, 'the SRNA moved immediately to divest itself of association with any labour organization or activity' (Slater-Smith, 25). Nurses now needed a new body for collective bargaining. On November 17, 1973, representatives of various SNAs met in Saskatoon to discuss their options. 'The meeting appointed a steering committee to examine alternatives enabling nurses to maintain their autonomy. The committee was to recommend the most suitable alternatives and prepare a proposed constitution for circulation to all SNAs in preparation for the next meeting' (Slater-Smith, 30).\n\nThe steering committee analyzed what other groups had done and decided to adopt a constitution similar to the Ontario Nurses' Association. It was at a meeting to discuss the steering committee's report that nurse Edna Button moved to form a labour organization. The motion was unanimously approved. Saskatchewan officially had a nurses' union.\n\nThe constitution for the newly formed union 'provided the province be divided into eight regions each with representation to the board of directors...Monthly membership fees were set at $2 a member, and the $1 monthly fee to cover the cost of negotiations would continue until negotiations ended' (Slater-Smith, 32).\n\nAlmost immediately following its birth, the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN) entered into job action for the first time. This strike was successful in that nurses made significant gains with respect to what they were requesting from employers. The wage increase amounted to 34% over the next two years, and the traditional 25 per cent 'spread' between the registered nurses and the certified nursing assistants was almost re-established with the gap now approximately 20%. Another important outcome of the strike was the inclusion of part-time and casual nurses in the collective agreement. The success of this job action set the tone for the next few years of SUN's history and established the union as a legitimate collective bargaining agent.\n\n",

      "article": "The birth of the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN) in Saskatchewan ushered in a new era for the nursing profession in Saskatchewan. No longer did nurses have to sit idly by when they wanted to see changes. Despite the gains from the early strike, many nurses entered into the new union with trepidation. Many considered the word 'union' a dirty word. They felt that nursing was a selfless profession that would belittle itself by creating a union to bargain for more money. With the inception of SUN however, many nurses changed their tune and realized that the union was about more than money.\n\nThe first few years that SUN was in existence proved to be extremely successful. 'By the end of 1975, SUN had accomplished many of its important goals, ensuring its future as a vigorous and forceful labour organization. Certification had been obtained and the Saskatchewan Healthcare Association (SHA) had recognized SUN as the bargaining agent of nurses' (Slater-Smith, 42). With the success of the union negotiations in 1974, SUN had gained the respect of many of Saskatchewan's nurses and had established itself as one of the largest unions in the province. Not only were monetary gains made in SUN's first-ever round of negotiations, but gains were also made with respect to working conditions. The latter showed doubters what the union was capable of in advancing nurses' rights. 'More and more nurses recognized the protection a union provided for them, both at the workplace and from the effects of a highly inflationary economy' (Slater-Smith, 45).\n\n1976 negotiations saw nurses fighting for pay equity with Alberta nurses. Nurses struck for ten days, after eighty-eight percent of the membership voted in favour of strike action. When the new contract was ratified, nurses had gained a twenty-two percent increase in wages, every third weekend off and a seven and three-quarter-hour day (down from eight hours).\n\nWhat is particularly interesting about the 1976 round is the shift in thinking on the part of many nurses. They had come to realize that being part of a union didn't have to lessen their professionalism.\n\n\n\nThe 1976 strike had taught SUN some important lessons. Perhaps most significantly nurses realized that the hospital system would not completely collapse when nurses withdrew services. The system would react; scale down patient loads, amalgamate services and organize sufficient support and medical staffing to handle almost any situation. With this realization the struggle between professionalism and unionism had firmly taken root. The solidarity of the membership was unquestionable and SUN's negotiations committee could deliver when the need arose (Slater-Smith, 57).\n\n\n\n",

Few contentious issues were raised at the annual meeting in March 1977 and there were no concerns about the union's administration' (Slater-Smith, 59). Al Shalansky, SUN Chief Executive Officer attributed the quiet in 1977 to exhaustion after the last round of negotiations. SUN's leadership was not ready for another fight, but by only signing a one-year contract in 1976 SUN had set itself up for negotiations in only one year's time.\n\n\n\nImprovements in hours of work and wages were SUN's 1978 primary objectives. Research had shown many nurses were working up to 10 consecutive days without a day off and that days off were grouped at the beginning and end of shift rotations...In 1978 wage levels had once again become a major issue. A Co-operative Wage Study conducted by Canadian Union of Public Employees, the Service Employees International Union, and the Saskatchewan Healthcare Association reclassified Certified Nursing Assistants(CNAs) upward, equal to orderlies, which resulted in wage increases for CNAs retroactive to 1976. Overnight the wage differential between CNAs and registered nurses was reduced from a hard-won 20 per cent to 11-12 per cent. The differential had been destroyed and SUN was determined to restore it (Slater-Smith, 66).\n\n\n\nThis became the major battleground for the 1978 round of negotiations.\n\nThe wage differential was something that the nurses had fought hard for and were not about to relinquish without a fight. Until 1978, nurses had been fighting a battle to be seen as professionals and to be respected as such. Wages similar to their assistants would be seen as an affront to nurses and an attack on their professional integrity. Negotiations proceeded and eventually most of the issues were agreed upon, but it was wage differentials that derailed the negotiations. Instead of taking job action, however, Shalansky recommended that they enter into arbitration.\n\nThe honourable Emmett Hall, known for his work on the Commission on Medicare in 1964, was chosen as chair of the arbitration board. SUN was holding out hope that Hall would see the valididty of their position. On September 13, 'despite SUN's brief and supporting documentation, the award provided for increases that created only a 10 to 11 per cent differential between RNs and CNAs' (Slater-Smith, 73).\n\nThis was the first time since its inception that SUN did not feel it had 'won' a round of negotiations. This deflated the union and led to a number of years of what SUN historian Colleen Slater-Smith calls 'growing pains.'\n\n",

      "article": "While SUN's first few years were almost unprecedented in terms of success, the honeymoon came to an end in 1978 when the Hall arbitration awarded registered nurses (RNs) an insufficient wage differential from certified nursing assistants (CNAs).\n\nAl Shalansky, a key figure in SUN's inception and then-CEO, was asked to resign at the 1982 annual meeting due to a resolution passed that SUN would 'endeavour to employ' nurses in senior positions wherever possible. This again created dissatisfaction amongst some union members. Shalansky was not a nurse, but had helped to create SUN and had a strong backing in the membership.\n\nProbably overshadowed by these events were other important steps taken in regard to education of union members. One key decision made at a SUN annual meeting was in 1978 when member education was recognized as a 'cornerstone of union activities,' essential not only for ensuring 'a steady supply of potential leaders for both local and provincial levels,' but also to enable a larger number of union members to be active and knowledgeable It was officially acknowledged that more nurses needed to be educated in the fields of communications, labour relations, bargaining and negotiations. (SUN 25 year pamphlet). In 1980, SUN hired Larry LeMoal, who had extensive labour relations experience, and assigned him to develop SUN's formal education program.\n\nSUN held seminars in various locations across the province and held labour schools where members could learn these skills. Virginia Kutzan, education committee chairperson, remembers the success of the first labour school:\n\n\n\nThat first school was so successful that the collective bargaining class ended up having a strike...They had been role playing and had got carried away. It was amazing! The union negotiating committee picketed our wind-up banquet the night before the school closed. The management committee and some members from other classes crossed the picket line, but many didn't. The instructors, president and CEO wouldn't cross, but waited for the problem to be resolved. The cook waited to serve the food and it got cold and some people were angry because the banquet was spoiled, but the union team just kept on picketing (Slater-Smith, 80).\n\n\n\nAnother positive step during that time was that of the creation of the National Federation of Nurses' Unions (NFNU). As early as 1975 the formation of such a body had been discussed, and SUN was one of the first unions to promote the idea (Slater-Smith, 89). In 1979, SUN was one of eight provincial unions that met in Montreal to set objectives for the federation and begin the process of drafting a constitution. The constitution was ratified in 1981 and the national federation was born.\n\nThe years of 1978-1982 were a period of both growth and division for SUN. The union experienced its first taste of discontent amongst the membership. At the same time, it experienced growth in numbers and in prestige as it made a splash on the national scene while founding the NFNU. SUN pulled through this period and emerged a stronger organization.\n\n",

      "article": "Saskatchewan is renowned for its ingenuity with respect to health care. The University of Saskatchewan upheld this reputation when it established, in 1976, the first correspondence course in nursing at any Canadian university. The course was a short course in preventive health care and was offered through the University Department of Correspondence Courses.\n\nPreventive health was a growing field at this time and many nurses who had already taken their education did not have experience in either preventive or community health. 'In the College's old five-year degree program, which was phased out in 1971, community nursing was an optional subject and some of the students, as well as some from other universities, graduated without experience in this growing field. As a result...they are at a disadvantage if they wish to seek community nursing positions in health regions or elsewhere' (The Sheaf).\n\nIn the 1970s, newer research was indicating that preventive medicine was more effective than the curative form of medicine which had been used as a primary method of treating illness. Preventive medicine focuses on keeping an individual healthy through health promotion and disease prevention while curative medicine focuses on treating individuals who are already ill. In 1975, a nursing program with emphasis on preventive care was very progressive.\n\n\n\nThe objective of the correspondence course [was] to help the nurses understand their role in a changing health delivery system that is placing increasing emphasis on preventive health. Health requirements [were to] be analyzed in terms of such factors as basic human needs, the environment and quality of life, disease and disaster...Among the topics to be taken up [were] prevention versus cure, the use of research, program planning and interdisciplinary approaches as well as developments underway in the Canadian health delivery system, including changed in required services and educational methods. In addition, attention [was] given to relations with the media and co-operation between volunteers and professionals (The Sheaf).\n\n\n\nThe short course was followed up with a full course at Intersession or during the summer semester on community health nursing. The full course was taken at either the Regina or Saskatoon campus.\n\n",

      "article": "SUN's very first round of job action took place the same year that the union was founded -it was the first province-wide withdrawal of nursing services in Canada. Many nurses were unhappy with the idea that they should go on strike as this was not something that had been done before. They were concerned about their patients and the quality of care they would receive if nurses were no longer on the wards. Colleen Slater-Smith, in her history of the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses begins the book with a compelling story:\n\n\n\nRegistered Nurse Jill Jones walked into the women's washroom at the Saskatchewan Department of Labour and threw up.\n\nShe had just realized that 2,500 nurses in more than 50 provincial hospitals would probably have to use their mandate to take strike action sometime within the next 10 days. It was unthinkable. Jones' knees shook. It was late April 1974 and hospital nurses were embroiled in a contract dispute with the Saskatchewan Hospital Association (SHA). The issue: wages - money!\n\nHow could nurses desert their patients over the issue of wages? A subject so indelicate in nursing conversations that it was discussed behind closed doors, in scrub rooms or linen closets - never in public (Slater-Smith, 1).\n\n\n\nThe issue behind the strike was, 'to establish parity with Alberta nurses and to restore the differential between Saskatchewan Registered Nurse (RN) and Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) salaries. The former differential of 25 per cent was reduced to 16 per cent in 1973 when CNAs were given a wage increase' (Slater-Smith, 34). Negotiations eventually collapsed over the wage differential issue. It was at this point that SUN requested a strike mandate from its members. Ninety-one percent of members voted to strike and the nurses were out for twenty-four hours.\n\nSUN received a wage increase of 23 per cent over the first year and 9 per cent in the second year, with the addition of a cost of living adjustment clause. The differential between RN and CNA salaries was raised to 23 per cent in the first year and 21 per cent in the second. This made union leaders happy and showed that even though the union was still in its infancy, it could make changes in the system to benefit nurses. This round of bargaining gave SUN the boost of confidence needed to continue as the new bargaining agent for nurses in the province.\n\n\n\n",

More time with family, however, means less paid time. For many it is a circle that never ends; every day is a struggle to keep a balance between work and family.\n\nJill Jones, second president of the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN), remembers,\n\n\n\n“…a lot of the work was done in your own time.  I know I would do full time work at the hospital and then on my days off I'd go up to the office and work for a couple of days.  Eventually, as the union progressed, we managed to negotiate time off for the president, and also leaves of absence for board members.  So it did improve after awhile.  I remember I took a three month leave of absence to go and work in the office whilst I was president because it was so time consuming, and I just couldn't do it all. \n\nIf I had to go away for a week I would have a week's worth of meals in the freezer.  But I had packaged meals, I had lists on the fridge.  The children remember their father doing a meal, and every meal he ever had was beans on toast.  That's how they remember their father, giving them beans on toast every meal.  Never touching my meals in the freezer.  And the children remember -- they don't sort of regret the days I worked.  I think they were pretty proud of me because I was ending up on television and things like this, and they just thought this was great.  How I managed I don't know.  I never, ever emptied a suitcase. I'd have one toilet bag that always stayed in the suitcase, and certain things that always stayed there, never even came out”\n\n\n\nRosalee Longmoore, current SUN president, also comments on juggling her career and family. If she had to be away, she often took her children and her husband with her, reminiscing that those times away with her family are some of the best she has had. One memory that Longmoore has is that of having her youngest daughter with her while she worked:\n\n\n\n'I was still with Long Term care at that time, so it was the strike of '88 was the hospital sector. But our youngest child was born on September the 1 st and in my job in SUN, I was on the provincial strike steering committee and in charge of essential services. And so on September the 8 th one week later, Savannah and I traveled to Saskatoon to attend a strike steering committee meeting. And once the strike was called, Savannah and I moved into the office. We had her bassinet in a corner in the officefice' (Interview: Rosalie Longmore)\n\n\n\n",

He had chronic nephritis, which is an infection of the kidneys and eventually after several hospitalizations had to be on dialysis. Back in those days there was one dialysis machine in Regina which was for emergency use only. So patients from southern Saskatchewan where I grew up could come, you know, were often brought here in a crisis, stabilized and if they required long-term dialysis, had to move to Saskatoon. So our family relocated to Saskatoon and we lived in an apartment across from St. Paul's Hospital so that my Father could have dialysis three times a week. And you know, I watched him suffer a lot and watched the people that were caring for him and I believe all of that contributed to my decision to enter nursing (Interview: Rosalie Longmoore).\n\n\n\nLongmoore graduated from Wascana Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences Technology in Regina, which is now SIAST, in 1976. Prior to and during her schooling she worked as a nurse's aide at a long-term care facility, Extendicare, in Regina. She was fortunate after her graduation to immediately have work in a new Extendicare facility in Regina as the only registered nurse working nights. Longmore loves long-term care nursing because she works with the disabled and the elderly. She also attributes part of her happiness at the time to the working environment.\n\n\n\n'The other thing about nursing back then is it was a much more stable environment in healthcare. So whether it was the registered nursing staff or the dietary staff it was a very stable work force and we too became very close like families. We all you know, had babies together, lived through the joys, the happiness, the tears, the sorrows that occur in people's lives and became like an extended family. And I think all of those things contribute to making people very satisfied in their work life'.\n\n\n\nLongmoore had been involved in the union from the time she began working. After a brief time off to get married, she became a local officer and was on the Extendicare bargaining committee. From these beginnings, she got involved in the larger union and in 1984 was elected to the board. She had various positions on the board, from representing nursing homes (the Region 8 representative) to being the Vice President of the long-term care sector. One success she remembers from her time on the board was that at one time every long-term care facility in the province had their own collective agreements. Longmoore worked to bring all of the facilities under one collective agreement, and then to achieve equity with acute care for nurses who worked in long term care.\n\nIn 1998, Judy Junor, then SUN president, decided to leave SUN to seek election in provincial politics. Longmoore was not sure if she could commit to working full time as SUN president, but decided after the board approached her that she would try the position for one year until the term was up. She quite enjoyed the challenge of the position and did run for president the next year. Longmore remains SUN president and continues to enjoy it: 'And one just never knows what a day will hold in our union and I continue to enjoy it. So as long as I continue to enjoy it, I will continue to try and to be here'\n\n",

Many nurses experienced emotional turmoil, because supporting each other and the union meant  leaving their patients.\n\nMary Parchewsky remembers the first time that SUN went on strike. There was mixed reaction amongst the nurses. Some were more than willing to take job action while others were reluctant to tie themselves to such action.\n\n\n\n'The experiences the first strike, it was really overwhelming, it was such a anti-nurse thing but pro-nurse as far as benefits were concerned and some of the nurses got locked out and they'd phone me in the middle of the night and say they were locked out of work and I don't know what to do, you know try to appease them and then I'd phone Al and say 'Al, what do I do now?' And then after the one of the hospitals, it wasn't a very large place but the nurses wrote me a letter and said they never wanted to go on strike again and never to ask them to go on strike again. Well when we were voting for our second strike that hospital nurses voted 100% because management had tried to shaft them on something that they had agreed to.....And it was really difficult, because they didn't, the hospitals didn't recognize the agreement as applying to each of them. They would try to negotiate something less than what we'd, they'd agreed and it, there were a few really rough, rough spots in that manner. And we'd have some fighting with the management at negotiations. One day we wore black roses because we were so depressed, we all wore black roses and we thought that would give them the message that we weren't happy. There were some really key people in our organization who at the right moment they would come up with the brightest ideas you know; it was just like a miracle had risen. They were the phoenixes, so it was really a great, great experience.\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "Nurses face a unique dilemma.\n\nOn the one hand they have a professional and ethical responsibility to protect the interest of patients. On the other hand, they are expected to obey directives from employers, even where such directives may compromise patient safety.\n\nThe only RN on night shift in a small hospital may become overwhelmed by new admissions, or critically ill patients who suddenly become unstable and need her full attention. She knows she needs another RN to provide safe care to her patients. She phones her supervisor to ask permission to call in a colleague to help. Her supervisor says, 'No, we're over budget, you will just have to cope.'\n\nIf she obeys her supervisor, thereby failing to maintain professional standards, she risks discipline from her professional association as well as legal liability for any harm arising to the patient. If she disobeys her supervisor, and calls a colleague in to assist, she may be disciplined by her employer, including suspension or dismissal.\n\nNurses who joined unions were seeking much more than protection against unjust dismissal, unworkable schedules, or inadequate salaries or benefits. Nurses also expect their unions to help solve this dilemma- responsibility without authority.\n\nFrom SUN's inception, the union was expected to represent and defend nurses who were desperately concerned about patient care. But, health care employers vigorously resisted any collective agreement provisions which restricted, 'management rights.'\n\nWith no provisions in the new collective agreements that required management to treat nurses' concerns about patient safety seriously, nurses took direct action, and SUN had to develop new strategies and processes (outside the collective agreement) to support them.\n\nIn June, 1975, the six general duty nurses at the Broadview Union Hospital resigned over concerns of a, 'steadily deteriorating working relationship with one of the doctors on staff.' This action by nurses lead to an investigation resulting in the permanent suspension of the doctor's privileges. (SUNSPOTS, Vol. 2, #1, March 1976, pp 6,7\n\nOn June 28, 1975, eight general duty nurses (the entire RN staff) employed by the Birch Hills Memorial Union Hospital submitted their resignations, in part because of a, 'dispute between the doctor and the hospital over the scheduling of certain major surgery with the result the doctor took certain action which placed nurses on duty on two shifts in an intolerable situation related to patient care.' (SUNSPOTS, Vol 1, No. 3, August 8, 1975, pp 4.)  \n\nThe doctor was also charged and found guilty of common assault against one of the nursing staff and agreed to sign a statement retracting remarks he made at a town meeting where he referred to nurses, 'in slanderous terms', referring to them as, 'two year bohunks ' and, ' two year wonders ' and alleging that they were responsible for patient deaths. The Hospital was closed from June to February of 1976. SUNSPOTS, Vol 2, No. 1, March, 1976, pp 7.  \n\nSUN decided to put pressure on the Birch Hills Hospital to reinstate the nurses by, 'Greylisting' the hospital. 'Greylisting' was a process where SUN publicly advised nurses in Saskatchewan not to seek employment with the hospital.\n\nSUN employed the 'Greylisting' strategy again when sixteen nurses at the Watrous Union Hospital went on strike on Wed, January 4 , 1978 over two staffing issues. The hospital failed to maintain normal RN staffing when the Director of Nursing was absent and replaced by a general duty nurse, removing one of the two nurses from the bedside. The hospital also refused to continue a provision to provide orientation for new nurses. The SUN Board of Directors voted to 'Greylist' the Watrous Union Hospital until the dispute was resolved. On January 20 th , an agreement was reached and the Greylist lifted. SUNSPOTS, Vol 4, No. 1, January 20, 1978, pp 3..\n\nWhile the drastic action of mass resignations and the 'Greylisting' policy had some success, nurses pressed SUN to negotiate improved staffing and patient safety provisions in their collective agreements.\n\nOn October 2 and 3, 1975, SUN's bargaining conference reached a consensus about key items for the 1976 round of negotiations, including: ' General improvement in areas of working conditions with respect to staffing, hospital ADC (average daily patient census) right to file complaint re workload, staff development.' (SUNSPOTS, Vol. 2, #1, March 1976, pp 1.\n\n'Be it resolved that SUN strongly encourages S.H.S.P. (Saskatchewan Hospital Services Plan) to establish a compulsory, functional, patient workload index as the criteria for allotting registered nursing positions in Saskathewan hospitals.' Resolution passed at March, 1976 SUN Annual meeting, (SUNSPOTS, Vol. 2, #1, March 1976, pp 3.\n\nDual Responsibility\n\nIn 1977, SUN was well aware of the conflict between a Registered Nurse's responsibility to the employer, and responsibility to the patients, and why nurses felt compelled to resign where that conflict became intolerable.\n\nSUNSPOTS, quoting an article that first appeared in the March, 1977 issue of Dimensions in Health Science, by Lorne E Rozovsky providing legal advice to nurses that, ' If a registered nurse forsees the possibility of patient injury as a result of the standards of nursing practice of the employing agency...she should\n\nAdvise the agency in writing of her concerns and suggest changes.\n\nWithin the employer's policies, abide by the standards of the average, reasonable and prudent nurse in the circumstances. If the policies are so incompatible with a reasonable professional standard, the nurse should resign . [emphasis added] Failure to abide by these standards may result in injury and liability of the nurse as well as the employing agency.' (SUNSPOTS, Vol. 3, #3, March 13, 1977, pp 8.)\n\nHoping to provide nurses with a powerful tool to help resolve this conflict, SUN members at the 1980 Annual Meeting passed a resolution directing that 'The Union develop and implement a Documentation Program incorporating the use of a, 'Professional Accountability Form'.

      "article": "The 1970s\n\nThe role of the Nurse Practitioner (NP) in Saskatchewan has its roots in the remote north, where nurses in isolated nursing stations have practiced an expanded RN role since the beginning of modern Canadian history. Where there was often no physician, nurses diagnosed, performed and ordered lab tests and x-rays, as well as treated most illnesses and injuries. The authority for the expanded RN role was, and in many cases is still, through delegation of medical function.\n\nA need was identified for independent primary care practitioners to serve the rural relatively isolated communities in southern Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan Nurse Practitioner Demonstration Project was developed collaboratively by a Joint Committee of many health and government sectors. Funding was announced by the Minister of Health in June, 1973. The College of Nursing accepted the role of creating the six month post-masters of nursing program in order to prepare four experienced nurses to function independently and collaboratively in primary care.  The nurses would also provide monitoring, continuing care and health supervision to patients and families.\n\nThe program focused on a physical exam and assessment skills, expanded knowledge of treatment and referral procedures. A high priority was put on development of clinical judgment, and on increasing the nurse’s confidence for the independent role that this form of nursing practice requires. Professional responsibilities, counseling and health education were emphasized throughout a wide range of clinical experiences.\n\nThe four nurse practitioners worked in three southern agricultural communities and one Métis region including three villages. They were responsible for providing diagnostic, treatment and preventative services within the framework of nursing, medical and pharmaceutical guidelines, and the objectives and standards of the project. They maintained careful statistics, as well as collected qualitative and quantitative data. Despite positive evidence of cost effectiveness, full utilization, high quality of care, competent clinical performance evaluation and record audits, and responsiveness to community needs, the project was droppedin October of 1976.\n\n\n\nThe 1990s\n\nBy the 1990s, there still was no legislation supporting the Nurse Practitioner title or role. Nurses continued practicing advanced clinical nursing, still almost exclusively in the north, by transfer of medical function. 'Health reform' discussions were starting to talk about strengthening primary health care and optimizing the skills of all health professionals. Expanding the role of nurses is one aspect of this health reform.\n\nA need was identified for a comprehensive program to prepare RN’s to fill this role. Another multi-disciplinary/multi-sectoral committee – working with partners including the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology (SIAST) Wascana – created the two-year, post-RN, Advanced Clinical Nursing program. The program had much of the content of the 'Project' program in the 70’s, with strength in clinical care. The first graduates were in 1994. The program has been responsive to the changing legislation and regulation, and to employer and communities needs and has evolved and expanded to become the Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Program. This is the only approved NP program in Saskatchewan.\n\n\n\n2000\n\nBy 2000, there was now work towards creating the title of Nurse Practitioner. The advanced clinical nurses were now dubbed Primary Care Nurses. This label also helped promote the movement towards primary health care reform, at least in theory. Some people still use these terms interchangeably; but, despite overlap in the roles, there is a difference. In Saskatchewan, a Primary Care Nurse is a nurse who provides both primary health care and primary care, and obtains the privileges of diagnosing, prescribing and ordering tests and x-rays by transfer of medical function. The Nurse Practitioner’s authority is by virtue of his or her RN (NP) license.\n\nThe Advanced Clinical Nurse graduates had few employment options other than the north. Saskatchewan Health was offering resources and a primary care nurse position to Physician practices who tried to meet the government definition of a primary care team.\n\n\n\n2001\n\nIn January of 2001, the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association (SRNA) created Nurse Practitioners of Saskatchewan, a special interest group of the SRNA for nurses working in expanded practice. This was mainly for Nurse Practitioner students and licensed R.N.-N.P.’s. As a result of the initiative, drive and resolve of Heather Keith, R.N., the inaugural meeting of the NPOS was held in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe NPOS has played an important role in moving to the historic licensing of the Nurse Practitioner by the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association.\n\nAfter much consultation and input from all stakeholders including many nurses, the Amendments to the RN ACT, 1988, Section 24, enabled the regulation of the RN (NP) role within Saskatchewan. The most important phrases are:\n\n'a) order, perform, receive and interpret reports of screening and diagnostic tests that are designated in the bylaws\n\nb)prescribe and dispense drugs ...\n\nc) perform minor surgical and invasive procedures...\n\nd) diagnose and treat common medical disorders'\n\nThe amended act opened further consultative work on the SRNA bylaws which took two years to complete.\n\n\n\n2003\n\nIn April of 2003, the Canadian Nurses Protective Society increased the limit of assistance to NP’s without increasing fees, based on the record of safe NP care with no NP claims.\n\nThe Canadian Nurses’ Association was granted a portion of the federal primary health transition fund to facilitate integration of the NP into the health care system, to create mechanisms and processes to support the integration and to sustain the NP role. The Canadian Nurse Practitioner Initiative (CNPI) was formed to avoid the fizzle and neglect of NP’s that happened in the 1970’s. Many of Saskatchewan’s RN’s and NP’s participated in the CNPI interviews, focus groups, stakeholder meetings, etc in the process of creating the CNPI.\n\nIn October, the SRNA released the 'Registered Nurse (Nurse Practitioner) Standards and Core Competencies' after much inter-jurisdictional and member consultation to reflect practice, client needs, and fit with national competencies\n\nIn 2003, potential NP’s currently working in primary care nurse roles began a lengthy process of application for approval.\n\n\n\n2004\n\nIn March, potential NPs received a letter from SRNA acknowledging receipt of all the necessary documentation application for RN(NP) license, with only one final form to complete and return to SRNA!\n\nIn April, the final status of NPs was close but still delayed pending Cabinet approval of the Attending Health Professionals Regulations and amendments to:\n\nThe Drug Schedules Regulations, 1997\n\nThe Hospital Standards Regulations, 1980\n\nThe Housing and special care Homes Regulations\n\nThe Medical Laboratory Licensing Regulations, 1995\n\nThe Saskatchewan Aids to Independent Living Regulations, 1976\n\nThe Saskatchewan Assistance Plan Supplement6ary Health Benefits Regulations\n\nThe Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Payment Regulations, 1994\n\nApril 30, 2004 about 10 AM All the required bylaws were proclaimed law in Legislature with key SRNA personnel in attendance!\n\n\n\n",

By 1986, the College of Nursing at the University of Saskatchewan had implemented a Master's degree in Nursing under Dean Una Ridley.\n\nLucy Willis, in her history of the College of Nursing, explains the first steps towards a master's degree in nursing at the University of Saskatchewan. Under the former Dean of Nursing, Hester Kernen:\n\n\n\nsome members of the College of Nursing faculty, on the basis of their preparation and research, were able to become members of the faculty of Graduate Studies and Research. For the most part this was educational for them, but it did establish a link. Secondly, one student was admitted to a special case graduate program in nursing. This was possible because faculty members worked on a proposal for a graduate program and presented it to the University College of Graduate Studies and Research. The proposal was turned down as a general program but the door was opened for individual students to apply and be admitted. During the early part of the 1980's several other students were admitted, one by one, to similar programs (Willis, 27).\n\n\n\nThe first special case student graduated with a Master's of Nursing degree in 1984.\n\nIn 1984, Dean Una Ridley received funds from the federal Government to conduct a feasibility study into a master's nursing degree at the University. Under the agreement, links were also to be made with the Regional Psychiatric Centre for those students interested in psychiatric nursing so the degree could be extended to Registered Nurses (RNs) and Registered Psychiatric Nurses (RPNs).\n\nThe University Senate approved the program in 1986. To be admitted, students were required to specify a clinical area for specialization. Students were to be registered to practise nursing in Canada and must have obtained a Bachelor's degree in nursing or equivalent.\n\n",

      "article": "The capabilities of a fully-equipped Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in less than half the space - this is the working environment in a Saskatchewan Air Ambulance. Dubbed Lifeguard one, two and three, these airplanes are equipped with the most modern of equipment. Everything inside the aircraft is compact and stowed and secured in its proper place. Everything is weighed prior to being put on board so that the planes are ready to take off at a moment's notice. The stretchers have teflon feet that sit on a teflon base so the bed glides easily on and off the aircraft. The Air Ambulance service is a fascinating example of high-tech modern medicine.\n\nEven though the equipment is new and of the highest quality, not much else has changed since 1946 when the service flew its first flight of mercy. There is still a pilot and a nurse on every flight. Flight nurses generally have 5 to 8 years of experience in critical care nursing prior to being hired as a flight nurse. That training is imperative given some of the high-stress situations in which flight nurses can find themselves. Flight nurses are also required to take an aeromedical course, given that caring for a patient in the air is different from caring for one on the ground. There are no doctors in the air so nurses have to be able to make snap decisions such as which drugs to give. There is a medical director who can authorize a transfer of function for flight nurses for specific events so they can provide needed care even if it is not within their regular scope of practice. If a patient deteriorates enroute, nurses first try and treat the patient with what they are authorized to do. If support is needed in treatment, the nurses call medical control to either receive advice or confirmation on what treatment to use.\n\nNot all flights are emergencies. Some flights take sick children to out-of-province children's hospitals and some take adults to specialists outside the province. Although it is not a service usually offered, on occasion Air Ambulance is able to bring people home who have had treatment elsewhere.\n\nDeaths have occurred on Air Ambulance Flights. Babies have been born aboard Air Ambulance flights. Every trip is a new challenge for flight nurses.\n\n",

      "article": "The Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN) advocates for a primary health care model wherein patients can gain access to primary health care twenty-four hours a day. In the early 1990s, a number of pilot projects were set up, the first of which was at Beechy, Saskatchewan, in an attempt to facilitate primary care teams. These teams would consist of any number of health care providers; physicians, registered nurses and nurse practitioners working together to ensure that a patient gets the most appropriate care by the most appropriate professional.\n\nThe first project at Beechy saw much involvement by SUN. SUN had to negotiate job descriptions and rates of pay for the nurse practitioner who would be working in the facility. The model remains in the community and has expanded to other communities near Beechy.\n\nIn recommendations to the 2001 Caring for Medicare Report prepared by Ken Fyke, SUN continued to advocate for a reformed primary care model. A 2000 edition of SUNSPOTS Spots , SUN's member magazine, outlines the major recommendations that SUN made to the Fyke report. These clearly underscore SUN's commitment to creating a primary care model in Saskatchewan:\n\n\n\nImplement province-wide primary care reform to provide citizens with 24-hour access to primary health care services\n\nA provincial network of community health centres employing multi-disciplinary teams, and a special program for nurses which combines education and experience in primary care settings. This would attract nurses from other provinces.\n\nPushing out fee-for-service and capitation in favour of a salaried model for Saskatchewan physicians.\n\nExpand medicare to fully fund primary health services, emergency services and home care, followed by long-term care, pharmaceuticals and expansion of the dental plan.\n\nPhase out private for-profit ownership of health delivery services that receive public funding.\n\nCreate an effective health human resources plan to ensure an adequate supply of all health providers, particularly nurses and physicians, and the creation of healthy work environments.\n\nInvest in a healthy society with policies to reduce poverty and unemployment, increase opportunities for education, social housing, paid maternity leave, family income support, increased minimum wages, early childhood support and development, environmental protection, occupational health and safety, food safety, health promotion and education.\n\nEstablish population health targets such as reducing premature births and infant mortality, chronic diseases and preventable accidents. Provide early screening, prevention, and treatment of major chronic and preventable diseases such as diabetes, health disease and lung cancer.\n\nReinforce national funding, standards, and appropriate trade policy to prevent expansion of for-profit health care.\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "'It has become increasingly evident, that we, as Nurses, are caught in a very difficult situation. On the one hand, as professionals, we have the responsibility to meet the individual needs of the patient for patient care and on the other hand, we are constrained by employment obligations which do not recognize or acknowledge a role for us in defining and identifying safe practices and quality care.\n\nThe situation has become so acute that most Nurses acknowledge that the responsibility of employment and professional standards are in conflict. The employee has the right and duty to protest, identify and document the conflict.' Documentation Program Update, SUNSPOTS, December 1980, Vol 6 No 4, pp 3.\n\nHoping to provide nurses with a powerful tool to help resolve this conflict between professional responsibility to protect patient safety, and the requirement to comply with employer directives which may undermine patient safety, SUN members at the 1980 Annual Meeting had passed a resolution directing that ' The Union develop and implement a Documentation Program incorporating the use of a 'Professional Accountability Form'. (SUNSPOTS, Vol. 6, #2, June 20, 1980, pp 12.\n\nSUN recruited Nancy Davis (formerly a Nurse Manager) as an Employment Relations Officer (ERO) and assigned her to implement the Documentation Program, which began as a pilot project on November 24, 1980. Larry LeMoal, currently a SUN ERO, recalls Davis's motivation, ' Nancy told me she didn't come to work for SUN because she supported union principles-she didn't. She came to work for SUN because she thought she could help nurses use the power of SUN's documentation program to make gains for patient safety and quality care that she couldn't accomplish as a nurse manager.'\n\nNurses at SUN's 1981 annual meeting passed a resolution directing the negotiating committee to negotiate a professional accountability clause in the collective agreement. This was achieved in the 1982-83 collective agreement. Nurses with concerns about patient safety now had a formal process:\n\n'Contact your immediate supervisor.... to make her aware of the situation and give her an opportunity to assist in the resolution of the problem.'\n\n'Write the reasons for the inability to provide safe patient care on the professional accountability form. .....'\n\n'The forms are distributed as per the instructions...'\n\n'The documented incidents are discussed by the documentation committee with nursing administrator at the Nursing Advisory Committee meeting.'\n\n'If nurses are to function as professionals, then we must be allowed input into the decisions and policies that affect our lives and the quality of care we deliver.' Joan Fockler, Chairperson SUN Negotiations Committee, December 1987, vol. 13, No. 10.\n\n'Some hospital managements are endeavouring to prevent nurses from filling in Work Situation Reports by issuing a policy on confidentiality.'   SUN Professional Accountability documentation committee report, SUNSPOTS, April 1987, Vol 13. No. 4, pp 17. The committee noted that these policies on confidentiality violated the intent of Article 38, which recognized the right of nurses to document concerns, and bring those to the attention of nursing management.\n\nYear: 1985     Work Situation Reports filed: 305\n\nYear: 1986     Work Situation Reports filed: 60\n\nYear: 1987     Work Situation Reports filed: 201\n\n\n\nSUNSPOTS, Vol 14. No. 7, September 1988, pp 7.\n\n\n\nFrom 1980 when the program began to September 1988, nurses filed 882 work situation reports, but with mixed results. According to Cindy Irwin, then chair of the SUN documentation program, 'While some committees are functioning in an atmosphere of reasonable trust and good will on the part of nursing management, there are some in which the discussion of staffing issues, workload and related nursing problems is perceived as threatening the autonomy of nursing managers...'\n\n \n\n'...It is obvious that bedside nurses still have no real input into the conditions of work and care of the patient imposed upon them. It also brings into sharp focus the increasing gulf between the nursing administration leadership determining staffing from a distance, and the nurse at the bedside having the responsibility for coping/accountability in the actual situation.'   SUNSPOTS, April 1988 Volume 14, No. 4, Pp 11\n\n'Due to inadequacy with the form, opposition from Management, and pressure from SHA at the bargaining table (regarding Article 38 and confidentiality) Nursing Advisory Committees across the province have not become the effective avenue for change we so desperately need in order to improve working conditions and safe patient care .' Cynthia Irwin, Chairperson, Documentation Committee, SUNSPOTS, May, 1988, Vol 14, No. 5, pp 5\n\n  In 1986 nurses filed 60 work situation reports, by 1987, that number had risen to 201.\n\n'The Nursing Advisory Committee is a big issue with the membership of the SHA-particularly the confidentiality aspect.....the SHA wants to modify the clause to the extent that SUN could never go public on a staffing issue.' SUN/SHA Hospital Sector Negotiations Committee report, SUNSPOTS, Vol 14. No. 5, May 1988, pp 2.\n\nLarry LeMoal, then SUN Communications ERO, remembers the internal debate within SUN. 'The Saskatchewan Healthcare Association (SHA) had insisted on a 'news blackout' while negotiations were continuing, which SUN had accepted. Yet, the SHA was also trying to muzzle nurses by insisting that Work Situation reports remain confidential within the facility.\n\nAs communications ERO, I believed that this was a powerful issue to mobilize our members and gain public support, so I wrote a memo urging the negotiating committee to end the news blackout, and suggested that SUN put a counterproposal on the table that added an Independent Assessment Committee to issue rulings on unresolved issues so that we could not only defeat the confidentiality demand, but improve the Nursing Advisory Committee process' LeMoal says that after a heated debate, the negotiating committee adopted the communications strategy and decided to put forward a new proposal for an Independent Assessment Committee.\n\nIn May, 1988, SUN responded to the SHA's insistence that Work Situation Reports remain confidential within the facility with a 'supplementary proposal' that strengthened the Nursing Advisory Committee process-A provincial independent assessment committee of three Registered Nurses who would issue recommendations concerning work situation reports that were unresolved at the facility level. SUNSPOTS, Vol 14. No. 5, May 1988, pp 2.\n\n'In contention is the Nursing Advisory Committee and the issue of confidentiality. SHA remains adamant that SUN members will not have the capacity to publicly voice our concerns when staffing patterns, levels and situations do not allow for the provision of safe nursing care.' Joan Fockler, Chairperson, SUN Negotiations Committee, SUNSPOTS, Vol 14. No. 7, September 1988.\n\nA Victory for Safe Patient Care\n\n90% of SUN's membership voted, and handed the negotiating committee a strong mandate-82% had voted in favour of strike action.\n\nA six-day withdrawal of services followed, including a major rally of striking members at the Regina Exhibition Grounds on October 12.\n\nTwo days later, on October 14th the SHA finally agreed to SUN's demand for official recognition of SUN Work Situation reports, protection against harassment or discrimination for nurses who filed Work Situation Reports, and an Independent Assessment Committee of three Registered Nurses to make recommendations to employers regarding nursing practice issues which remained unresolved at the facility level. Other outstanding issues were settled, and the strike was over.\n\nCarry a big stick\n\n(SUNSPOTS noted that even the stars had lined up in favour of SUN that day, reprinting President Paul Kuling's horoscope for Friday October 14 th (the date of the settlement) 'Be diplomatic, but be sure others know you are not without allies. Talk softly, but carry a big stick. Message will become increasingly clear. Focus on employment, depedents, basic rights.'\n\nInsert Photo from page 4 SUNSPOTS 'Only pitbulls are meant to be muzzled' October 12 th rally.\n\n'SUN members have fought a hard battle to ensure that they are not muzzled by employers who would prefer them to be seen and not heard.' Chris Rawson, SUN Executive Director, SUNSPOTS, Vol 14, No. 9, November, 1988, pp 3.\n\nBinding Independent Assessment Committee decisions\n\nTen years later, SUN had determined that some employers had decided they could ignore decisions of the Independent Assessment Committee. Accordingly, SUN's bargaining conference directed the committee to negotiate a provision which would make IAC decisions, binding, similar to arbitration board decisions.\n\nThis demand was one of the issues that led the 1999 strike, and SUN's demand that Independent Assessment Committee ruling be binding on employers was the last issue to be resolved during the strike.\n\nHowever, the memorandum of agreement ending the strike, while specifying that 'Decisions of the Independent Assessment Committee will be binding', contained a reference that said, 'The [IAC] committee will consist of a representative of the employer, a representative of the union, and a neutral chair.(3) There shall be a roster of five persons agreed upon as chairs.'\n\nSAHO was demanding that IAC representatives, including the chairperson, no longer had to be nurses.\n\nhttp://www.sun-nurses.sk.ca/about_history/1999_strike_settlement.html\n\n13. Article 52 - The resolution of the matters of composition of the Independent Assessment Committee and the process of that committee shall be resolved through binding arbitration utilizing a three person board. The hearing shall be held within three months of signing the memorandum of agreement.\n\nhttp://www.sun-nurses.sk.ca/about_history/1999_strike_settlement.html\n\nThe arbitrator's decision resulted in SAHO's position being adopted, namely that the IAC need not consist of Registered Nurses, although decisions of the IAC would now be binding on employers.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "Nurses are tired. Working overtime is normal, even expected. Wards are crowded with patients waiting to be seen but often there is not enough staff to meet their needs.\n\nAt various times throughout Saskatchewan's history, the province has experienced a shortage of nurses. The current shortage is perhaps the most pressing as now, more than ever before, nurses are receiving a Saskatchewan education but are then leaving the province in pursuit of higher salaries.\n\nSUN's Febuary 2006 correspondence to the province's Minister of Health outlines their concerns about the nursing shortage:\n\n\n\n'The Saskatchewan Union of Nurses is concerned that Saskatchewan is currently suffering a chronic and deepening shortage of RNs and RPNs, producing negative consequences for safe patient care, positive patient outcomes, and public access to needed services. This nursing shortage also has negative consequences for the profession, damaging the province's ability to retain experienced nurses, and attract new nurses to the profession and to the province.\n\nSaskatchewan has the worst RN retention rate of all the provinces, with no progress since 1997.\n\nRN supply has declined by .5% since 2000, compared to a 5.7 % increase in Manitoba, and a 6% increase in the Canadian RN workforce. Only Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia suffered net decreases in the RN workforce from 2000-2004. 1\n\n33.2% of RNs (both new graduates and experienced nurses) who graduated in Saskatchewan have moved to other provinces, primarily Alberta and British Columbia. Only 66.8% of graduates from Saskatchewan nursing programs who were employed in Canada in 2004 were employed in Saskatchewan. Saskatchewan has made no progress in retention of Saskatchewan RNs since 1997, when the retention rate was 67%. '\n\n\n\nNursing shortages take their toll on those practising in the province. Some nurses leave the profession because of excessive amounts of overtime work and others leave because of the stress of having excessive nursing workload with little or no support. In 1999, during job action taken by SUN, nurses took their old and worn out shoes to the steps of the legislature to symbolize those who had left either the province or the profession because of working conditions.

      "article": "On the morning of April 7, 1999, 8,400 registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses, members of the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses walked off the job. They were legislated back to work six hours later by the Romanow government. SUN members from across the province immediately gathered at a huge rally at Regina’s Centre of the Arts in response to the news that they were being legislated back to work.\n\nWhen SUN’s leadership sought direction from the membership, nurses expressed their frustration and anger with the government’s decision to legislate rather than negotiate. “Hell no, we won’t go”, became the nurses’ rallying cry. The illegal strike affected most health care facilities in the province, including hospitals, home care, public health, mental health care, and long-term care facilities. The strike lasted 10 days before a signed memorandum of agreement ended the strike.\n\nBy 1999, Saskatchewan’s nursing shortage had deepened. Nurses in the province were migrating to Alberta, B.C. and the United States, attracted by higher wages, better staffing, and generous recruitment benefits. Nurses remaining in Saskatchewan were facing excessive overtime, cancelled vacations, double shifts, and the frustration of attempting to provide safe patient care on understaffed units. Prior to the strike, SUN held a “shoe-in” , covering the steps of the legislature with hundreds of discarded nursing shoes to symbolize the deepening nursing shortage.\n\nSUN’s proposals targeted the nursing shortage, and included requiring health employers to adhere to professional standards for the nursing profession, and improving wages and benefits to stem the out-migration. Nurses wanted Independent Assessment Committee (achieved in the 1988 strike) decisions regarding workload and other professional standards to be binding on employers. They also wanted a major increase in salaries, to match a pay equity increase granted to SUN members previously employed by the federal government.\n\nThe settlement produced a 13.7 percent raise in pay and benefits over three years. Arbitration produced a revised Independent Assessment Committee that met SUN’s demand that IAC staffing decisions would be binding.\n\nFor more detailed information regarding the 1999 strike, go to the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses website history section at http://www.sun-nurses.sk.ca/about_history/1999_strike.html\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Health Reform in Early 1990s - Nurses' Perspective",
      "article": "Many nurses found themselves out of work after a large scale restructuring of the health care system in Saskatchewan in the 1990s. Health Districts were created in an attempt to integrate and coordinate care. The Saskatchewan Drug Plan, one of the most generous in the country at that time, had been incrementally scaled back until it basically no longer existed except for those on low incomes Health system funding was changed to place greater emphasis on population demographics of each of the health districts. Furthermore, government announced there would be greater emphasis on primary health care and health promotion and disease prevention; a concept that government termed 'wellness.'\n\nThe Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN) has always advocated for this type of health reform. Nurses are front-line health care workers and as such recognize the importance of emphasizing health promotion and disease prevention. This reform was clearly within the realm of SUN advocacy. In September of 1988, SUN made recommendations to the Commission on Future Directions in Health Care. Clearly their recommendations reflect wellness reforms:\n\n\n\nNurses and other health-care professionals are currently experiencing extreme frustration because of their inability to provide quality care in current circumstances. They are, however, a tremendous reservoir of necessary energy and creativity to provide the quality care that Saskatchewan citizens expect and deserve. We believe Saskatchewan citizens want and need a health-care system that is universal, accessible, comprehensive, portable, and publicly administered. We believe Saskatchewan citizens want and need a health-care system primarily based on preventative, community-based public health programs. We do not believe Saskatchewan citizens can afford the tremendous waste and cost of continuing a 'sick-care system.' Nor do we believe Saskatchewan citizens can afford privatization or profit-making in our health-care system (Presentation to the Saskatchewan Commission on Directions in Health Care - Summary).\n\n\n\nHowever, health reform became tainted by the conversion of 52 hospitals to wellness centres that offered sharply reduced services and hours of operation. Countless nurses lost their jobs. The facilities that were converted were small hospitals in small communities. Many of the nurses who lost jobs were those whose income propped up that of the family farm. At first SUN was open to genuine reform, but it soon became apparent that the government's 'wellness' initiative seemed to really mean facility closures, health care cuts and massive layoffs of nurses.\n\n",

      "article": "With advances in technology have come interesting new ways for nurses to practise. Recently, in many provinces, nurses have been recruited for providing health information over the telephone. Saskatchewan's version of this new technology is HealthLine, a toll-free number accessible from anywhere in the province. Experienced registered nurses staff the telephones twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, providing varying kinds of advice to callers. Saskatchewanians can call and speak with a registered nurse about a health problem, ask general questions about their health and health care, and even ask about the closest place to rent crutches. Nurses can then suggest a possible course of action: for the caller with symptoms, they can advise on whether or not the patient should see a doctor and within what time frame they should do so. For the patient wishing to voice a concern to a specific department, the HealthLine nurses can transfer their call. If a call is believed by the nurse to be critical, they are even able to link to an ambulance service.\n\nWhile nursing via telephone is very different from nursing at the bedside, those who work at HealthLine tend to enjoy a high degree of job satisfaction. Working in an environment like this nurses can use the full scope of their training because they never know what concern the next call will bring - they\n\nHealthLine is very new in the province and has yet to undergo serious utlilization studies. However, there is a possibility that technology such as this can decrease the burden on other parts of the health care system. For example, a patient who would, at one time, have gone to a doctor for a minor ailment can now pick up the telephone and inquire as to whether they should see a physician. Not only does this allow the caller to receive medical advice from the comforts of home, but it also can decrease the number of physician visits for minor ailments that can be just as easily and safely self-treated.\n\n",

They asked us to bring in Mr. Dorsey and give him the authority to sort out complex jurisdictional issues they have been struggling with ever since the health care system was restructured.\n\nMr. Dorsey was directed to consider new employment relationships resulting from restructuring as well as the need to promote integration of delivery and consistency of employment conditions. He has developed a framework for labour relations in the health sector which reflects those terms of reference.\n\n(Saskatchewan News Release, January 17, 1997)\n\n\n\nIn 1997, the Dorsey Commission made recommendations on union jurisdiction in health care. Ultimately, Dorsey recommended that all registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses be rolled into Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN) jurisdiction. SUN grew rapidly at that point. Some nurses felt that they were being forced into something that they did not want while others were excited at the prospect of joining SUN.\n\nWith this move, SUN's leadership tried to keep what Rosalee Longmoore, president of SUN, called the 'better thans' (locally negotiated conditions that were superior to the provincial agreement) from all of the collective agreements. And if SUN could not achieve the 'better thans' for all nurses, to at least keep the positives for the people that who already had them:\n\nBut what we did at that bargaining table was try to bring all of the 'better thans' if you will, from all of the collective agreements where these nurses had been represented by other Unions before, to make sure that we carried on, carried those forward. We tried to get them for everybody, if we couldn't get them for everybody; our backup position was to keep them for the people that'd had them. And so I think we've been very successful some of the things we were able to get for everybody, we, you know, in subsequent rounds as well but we have been able to retain the provisions that were superior for those people as well (Interview: Rosalee Longmore).\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "“I have GOT to move upstream….”\n\nDebra Bathgate RN (NP), currently Primary Care Nurse Practitioner at the Family Medicine Unit of the Regina General Hospital outlines why she decided to become a nurse practitioner and the process she went through.\n\nMy decision to become a nurse practitioner was a nebulous idea for years! It started in 1995 at 2:30 in the morning when I was checking one of my CCU patients. As I looked at the man sleeping in the bed I couldn’t help but reflect on the fact that his grandfather was one of my first CCU patients, and was in this bed. Since then his father had also been in that CCU bed in my care! Three generations I had cared for in that bed!\n\nTwo thoughts occurred to me: I have been doing this job LONG ENOUGH, and I have GOT to move upstream, to try to prevent heart disease hitting each successive generation 10 years earlier than the previous generation.  Try to keep these people out of hospital.\n\nAfter some reflection and research, I began a long journey as a 'mature Student' in Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology’s Advanced Clinical Nursing program. This is now the Primary Care Nurse Practitioner program, which is the only Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association-approved Nurse Practioner program in Saskatchewan.\n\n\n\n“Over My Dead Body”\n\nI had worked for over 20 years in a small hospital in Weyburn. My employer provided moral and financial support, and unpaid leave for clinical rotations through my Advanced Clinical Nursing program. The management was moving towards alternate services in the health district and often reassured me that positions would be opening for me and other NPs.  These reassurances encouraged me to persevere through the long and difficult program. The month I finished my program, with still no sign of a Nurse Practitioner position in the community, a physician in Weyburn told my friend, 'Over my dead body will a nurse practitioner ever work here!”\n\nI finished the program in October of 2000, one month after my oldest son entered university! I was lucky to obtain the position of Primary Care Nurse in the Family Medicine Unit-Regina in February 2001 when Nurse Practitioners were still not a legal title in Saskatchewan.\n\nI am actually very grateful that doctor had shared his sentiments with my friend, because it gave me the incentive  to apply for my current position in Regina. After almost six years working in Regina as a Primary Care Nurse Practitioner, the 'Over My Dead Body' physician is still hail and hearty, and there is still no hint of a nurse practitioner position in the community.\n\nIn 2001, after much consultation and input from all stakeholders including many nurses like me, Amendments to the RN ACT, 1988, Section 24, enabled the regulation of the RN(NP) role within Saskatchewan. The most important phrases even included some of my wording.  But we were still quite aways from formal recognition.\n\nIn 2003, the Canadian Nurses Association was granted a portion of the federal primary health transition fund to facilitate integration of the NP into the health care system and to create mechanisms and processes to support the integration and to sustain the NP role. The Canadian Nurse Practitioner Initiative  (CNPI) was formed. Many of Saskatchewan’s RN’s and NP’s participated in the CNPI interviews, focus groups, stakeholder meetings. I was interviewed five times.\n\n(I was privileged to participate in a multi-stakeholder CNPI meeting in Ottawa in June 2005. The CNPI report, 'Nurse Practitioners, the time is now- A solution to Improving Access and Reducing Wait Times in Canada' was released June 20, 2006 in Saskatoon during the CNA Biennium. Of course I had to be there!)\n\nIn September of 2003 I and other potential NP’s working in primary care nurse roles received letters from SRNA outlining an extensive application processes. This was one of several changes and lengthy forms nurses like me submitted in the NP licensing process.\n\nOn March 25, 2004, I received a letter from the SRNA acknowledging receipt of all the necessary documentation in my application for an RN(NP) license, with only one final form to complete and return to SRNA!\n\nFinally on April 30, 2004 at about 10 am, all the required bylaws were proclaimed law in the Legislature with key SRNA personnel in attendance! An hour later SRNA staff phoned me with the GREAT NEWS that I was now officially an RN(NP). I was the 4th NP of of 9 who were licensed in the province that day!\n\nMy collegue physicians, nurses, social worker and staff had a celebration with me!\n\nNow, a nurse can become licensed as an RN(NP) by applying after successfully completing an approved NP program, meeting SRNA RN requirements, and practice hours, successfully passing a national primary care NP (all ages) exam, and paying the fee. As of 2006 there are 85 NP’s in Saskatchewan and 6 nurses with pending NP licenses.\n\nI really enjoyed participating on the Canadian Nurses Association NP exam committee for two sessions, December, 2003 and December, 2004. What a great learning experience, and introduction to networking with NPs across Canada.”\n\n\n\nWhat a Nurse Practioner’s practice looks like…\n\nMy current role is still evolving. I am in a busy family practice teaching unit. I love the environment! I see patients by appointment at least 4 days per week. My scope is minor common illnesses and injuries, and management of stable chronic conditions. Every day is different: sore throats, earaches, periodic health exams, sprained ankle, pneumonia, contraception counseling and follow up, PAP’s, well baby checks, child health and prenatal checkups, etc.\n\nIn chronic diseases, the Family Medicine Unit-Regina is becoming proactive in managing the care of people with diabetes and heart disease. This has involved “collaborative” meetings and program planning/recalls in quality improvement cycles. At least half a day a week is related to this.\n\n Because Outreach is historically part of the NP role, and because being a resource to the community is a Department of Family Medicine value, I do half a day per week at the Al Ritchie Health action center. This center has a team that is non-medical, who’s goal is to improve health by addressing the determinants of health. While there I do much the same work, plus foot-care for a few residents. If the need arises, I will make home visits.\n\n*The best thing about family practice is the relationships I build. For example, a young woman came to me for a periodic health exam which included contraception and health teaching, in preparation for her marriage. Soon her mother began to see me. After some time the young woman brought her husband with her after trying unsuccessfully to conceive. Soon I was sharing with her, the husband, and her mother at a family visit the results of a positive pregnancy test! I did her first prenatal checkup. At this time we collaborated with her physician to plan the prenatal care and delivery, and I did prenatal checks when the family physician was away. We rode the bumpy and emotional journey together, now with her husband and mother, while the pregnancy survived a threatened miscarriage. Now one of my joys is to watch her beautiful daughter grow when I see them for well baby checks and minor problems like and earache. And I continue to see the babe’s Mom and Grandma for their well women health care. Life is truly rewarding when my work builds relationships like these that encompass both the tears and the joys the blessings of life bring! I have often said, and continue to feel that I am the luckiest nurse in Saskatchewan.\n\n",

      "article": "Ten nursing graduates accepted their degrees from the University of Saskatchewan in May of 1943, only one-third of the thirty that enrolled in the 1938 program. Today, over one thousand students are enrolled in the Nursing Education Program at the University of Saskatchewan. The program has grown and changed significantly since its small beginnings.\n\nNursing was established as a school of nursing under the direction of Kathleen Ellis in 1938. The school achieved college status in 1973 - a time when nursing education in general was changing from a hands-on, hospital-based training program to a college-based, academic program with limited practicum work. During the same year, the Bachelor of Science degree in nursing was introduced. Students would no longer receive an Arts degree and nursing training, but a degree in their actual field of study.\n\nThe College currently offers a three or four-year nursing education program (depending on the number of prerequisites the students have) in three cities across the province: Saskatoon, Regina and Prince Albert. The program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing. Nurses wishing to continue their education at the Master's level can also do so at the University of Saskatchewan with either a thesis or course-based program. The College also offers a Native Access Program to Nursing which the College of Nursing describes as 'a support and retention service for Aboriginal nursing students.'\n\nBecause the College is committed to continuing nursing education, it offers opportunities for professional development and other continuing education programs.\n\n",

In a province with a large Aboriginal population, an influx of nurses with an Aboriginal background can bring a certain level of comfort to Aboriginal patients, according to Glenna Olenick, a long-time Aboriginal Registered Psychiatric Nurse. Non-Aboriginal nurses do not always have the same sympathy for Aboriginal patients as they are not familiar with the culture and traditions and even the food that Aboriginal patients are used to. Olenick believes that education is the key to creating a stronger Aboriginal nursing workforce;\n\nOlenick also believes that a stronger Aboriginal workforce could lead to further usage of traditional methods.\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "In 2004, men made up 3.2% of Saskatchewan's nursing workforce; below the Canadian average of 5.4%. Nursing is a profession traditionally associated with women. Even today, when women make up increasing percentages of traditionally male fields, such as law and medicine, men have not seen a parallel increase in their numbers in the nursing workforce.\n\n'Among male RNs the most frequently identified areas of responsibility in 2004 were Medicine/Surgery (17.6%), Psychiatry/Mental Health (13.2%), Critical Care (9.3%) and Emergency Room (9.0%). Despite the fact that males comprise only 5.4% of the RN workforce, males account for 14.4% of all RNs employed in Psychiatry/Mental Health' (Canadian Institute for Health Information, 38). The Weyburn psychiatric facility, for example, had a full complement of male nurses to work the male patient wards. For a large portion of the institution's history, female nurses were not allowed to work on the male wards.\n\nMale nurses were some of the pioneers of the profession, tending to wounded soldiers during wars. But since the actual registration of nurses began, men have made up a very small proportion of them.\n\nThe reason for such a small number of male nurses is difficult to determine. Cultural and social biases that discourage men from entering nursing certainly play a role. An article published in the March 2004 issue of On Campus News , a University of Saskatchewan newsletter, points to stereotyping as the main barrier to males entering the nursing profession. Male nurses will often be mistaken for doctors; a stereotype that has been difficult to overcome. Furthermore, a lack of role models in the profession and among university faculty is a factor. The University of Saskatchewan College of Nursing 'has made a concerted effort to hire male faculty (it has two)...but it has yet to provide protected seats for male students as it does for Aboriginal applicants, another group underrepresented in the profession' (On Campus News). An article in a University of British Columbia newsletter also points to the portrayal of nurses as seductive females in movies and on television as a contributing factor (Forgacs).\n\nSystemic biases of educational institutions, unions and workplaces are more difficult to pin down. Larry Connell, a nurse in Alberta, mentions that his union has a constitution that refers to nurses as 'her' and 'she', but mentions that he's willing to 'work on that.' His experience has been that most patients are receptive to male nurses and, except for the odd co-worker taking exception, gender has never been a barrier for him in his work.\n\n\n\n",

      "article": "Larry Connell is a visible minority on the job. He is a male nurse. Although he has experienced prejudice because of his gender, he does not let it bother him.\n\n\n\nWell, I'll give you some of the history. First of all, men -- men were the first nurses, and not in terms of the biological definition of nursing, to feed, but in the -- in the wars, it was the Christian Brothers who were nursing the -- who were attending, if you will, to the injured on the -- on the fields. While they may not take part in the war, they were taking part in the healing. And the forefront of most medical science surgery has been on the battlefront. You know, this wonderful -- wonderful plastic surgeons that came out of Vietnam. That's a sad note, but -- so men have been in the attending, care, treating field, outside of doctors, for centuries, literally. Since the registration of nurses to the best of my knowledge right up until I entered nursing, there was between one and three percent male RNs. Not visible though. They tended to go into psychiatry. They tended to go into urology. And not necessarily be in the visible eye of general care. And I think we've migrated out to those areas now. I don't know that our percentage numbers have increased much more than that. I don't know. But it's never been an issue for me. I've always maintained that Sally can fight fires. And if the equipment is -- if she's not able to carry the equipment, then we should be making equipment that is bearable by workers. So -- so yeah, if Sally can fight fires, Larry -- Larry can be a nurse. And I don't care what you call it. If nursing is a female term, but -- I'll live with that. The resistance I've had mostly has been through my colleagues and not through the patients. When I was a student, and I was in maternity -- I was assigned to maternity, I had met one of the nurses in a social atmosphere then. Okay, now I'm dating myself. It was discotheque. And she expressed to me extreme, extreme resentment to me being on the maternity ward. And I asked her, I said, Well, what about the male doctors? They're on the maternity ward. And she said, That's different. And I said, Do you know that most of the patients are very, very welcoming when I introduce myself and -- and provide care? It didn't matter to her. I didn't belong to her. She was an extreme. Very young girl, too, which surprised me. Usually you'd think it with the older girls. But the older nurses were -- women were more accepting. Most of the resentment or isolation I've met throughout my career has been through my colleagues and not through the patients so much. But most of my colleagues are very, very accepting. Of course my -- my union has a constitution that constantly says hers and she throughout, but we'll work on that.\n\n\n\n",
